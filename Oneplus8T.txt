  Review after using 8 days (12GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered Lunar silver but received Aquamarine green. I dont' want to spent more time on it, so kept it and it looks good too.Pros:=> Great performance/speed=> Good battery life=> It is priced good considering highend features the phone provides=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Experienced high heating when using the InShare app for sharing media.  This may be because of this app.=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this.As others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, but noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingCamera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. Overall it's a Beast! Highly recommending.

  This is my first OnePlus mobile so I can't compare with other OnePlus mobiles.Pros:120hz display for smoother display and touch experienceFast charging : 0 - 100 % within an hour in optimzed charging mode (else it'll charge in 40 mins, I didn't try it). Battery backup is also very good.No curved display : Personally I like flat displays as curved one is more prone to get cracks and damage easilyCase and Screen protector : you will get case in the box and Screen protector already applied to mobile which are of very decent quality.Oxygen 11: comes with Android 11 based Oxygen 11 OS and features are very cool.Performance : I have been using it from last 4 days but didn't notice any lags. But I am not a gamer so Can't say how it performs while gaming.Misc: Watched a water durability test video which claims it's water resistant but there is no official IP rating on it. Front and back side of the mobile are protected by Corning gorilla glass 5.Rest all specs like 5g, 865 Snapdragon, RAM, Storage, Camera setup,Full aluminium body etc are similar to OnePlus 8.During sale got the mobile with 1 year screen protection plan from ACKO without any extra cost.Cons:Front camera : I felt selfie camera quality could have improved. Looks like software issue, hope OnePlus will fix it in their future updates.Wide angle camera : Needs some improvement.Monochrome camera : I don't think so it's useful, anyone can apply filter and convert the picture to B/W. For the sake of quad camera it's just present.I don't see any other cons, I hope the software issues for cameras that I mentioned in the cons section will get fixed in future s/w updates. Really it's a great mobile.Edit- after used for a weekBack camera is struggling a lot in artificial light conditions.

  Please dont buy 8T. OnePlus is making everyone fools. Never Expected these sort of things. Complete flavour of OnePlus is missing in OnePlus 8T, Completely disappointed and Regret to chose Oneplus 8T. 48mp camera is a clear bogus always camera by default using 12mp camera only. 48mp camera is not at all perfect. OnePlus Messaging App, OnePlus Dialer,Call recording feature, Vehicle parking, Cards, OnePlus Gestures...... many more default OnePlus apps are missing ... All apps are replaced with Google's  stuff in 8T. UI became uncomfortable with these Apps. missing real oneplus feeling.Battery is very disappointing Not even giving 4 hours backup also. waste of money

  This is second mobile i have bought in first sale itself (first being moto g5 plus on flipkart)Here are the pros :1.120 Hz Fluid AMOLED Display2. 5G Snapdragon 8653. Oxygen OS 114. Android 11 (out of the box)5.65 W “Warp charge” (the charging is whooping fast, charger in the box)6. Type-C to Type-C Cable7. no curved screen (mayb a few like it but i don't)8. As we all know 3 years of guaranteed updates.Loaded with these features the mobile comes at 43k . With HDFC discount and exchange offer it can go down further.I think this is best mobile u can buy in this price range.

  Camera is  the major weak point of this phone,just like it was for OnePlus 8.It seems as if OnePlus are now taking their customers for granted.Their thought.process seems to be that most customers are happy with a camera that is just above average and they shove these useless macro and depth sensors down our throats instead of a solid telephoto lens like the one on 7t.I purchased this 8t only bcos it had a flat screen and that I would anyways be using a Google camera port for the camera,because the phone excels in every other area except camera.So if camera is your top priority you would be better served with phones like galaxy s20 fe .If you are one of those tech enthusiasts who is any way going to use a gcam mod , then you can very well go for this phone and you wouldn't be dissapointed.My main issue with the camera is the Inconsistent white balance. The primary camera is capable of taking some great shots when it gets it right. OnePlus needs to up their camera image processing game.Another main issue while clicking pics is the extremely variation in white balance between regular and 2x portrait shots.For 2x portrait shots the white balance is totally off.

  Product is good except camera. Oxygen Os is not upto the mark this time. Seems they haven't done proper testing on android 11.After spending 45k u will get a normal camera which was there in 7t and buggy OS.Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.Hope they come out with updates to solve the problems.I would rate 3 star for this device atleast for now.

  Have been using OnePlus phones for past 5+ years in the family. My last one is OnePlus 5T  which I exchanged and bought new phone OnePlus8T. Here is my review after using for more than a weekPros:Excellent and smooth 120Hz displayGaming experience is niceCons:1) Battery backup is horrible possible reasons could be phone signal keeps on varying whereas my earlier phone OnePlus5T has stable signal strength. Even otherwise battery backup is horribly wrong2) Adjusting screen brightness takes 1-2s delay to take affect3) Camera quality is not upto the mark in indoors4) while trying to make the phone 5G ready, I feel they have messed up 4G connectivity/signal things big-time.5) Alarms sometimes doesn't work properly.

  Pro -- One of the Best Display with brightness upto 1100 nits . ( Fluid Amoled the same display Samsung uses in its S20 Ultra, it's far better than Super Amoled display)- Oxygen Os Smoothness and Speed.- Fast Charging.- Great Selfie Camera.- Vapour Chamber for Cooling.- One of the Fastest Chipset.- 120hz butter smooth Display.- Stereo Speakers.Con -- Old Camera Sensor = Though I seriously like the Camera, I got the first Update and there was a lot of improvement in overall picture quality, ofcourse If You will Compare it with IPhone definitely You will find some thing missing. Overall the Cameras are awesome, it satisfied My needs.### For those Who are comparing it with Samsung S20 FE, Google Pixel 4a and Mi10T Pro ###> Samsung S20 FE - It has Exynos(4G), which is Trash and there's no way it can compete it with the SD865 (5G).> Google Pixel 4a - Poor battery life, heating issues, Plastic body, Small Screen, Cameras are good but You can't Zoom in due to Low Pixels, hangs or heats up too much while doing heavy task or while gaming or while using multiple social media apps.> Mi10T Pro - Bad display ( only IPS LCD no AMOLED), MIUI contains too much Advertisements ( everytime You install or open or even use the Phone an advertisement will pop-up from nowhere), Poor Cooling management for 144hz gaming.==== At this Price Point You wont get a better Phone with SD865, Fast Charging, Great display, Oxygen OS smoothness and a lot more  ===

  Charging speed is good, battery backup and camera is average, issue in dynamic range, no night mode in front camera,needs to improve in camera, software issue also there, gallery recalculats every time all photos of the albums, and takes some time to create photos after taking shotsBlue tint when taking photos at low battery, gallery loading (recalculating), heating up, camera is average, does not get a feeling of using a premium phone paying on higher side

  No doubt, it's an upgrade over oneplus 8. So many features are added like 65W charger,120Hz refresh rate etc. But believe me, the quality of camera is worst. Oneplus 7 has better camera than this phone. I have been using oneplus 7 since 2 year.  Recieved this product with bubble on screen. If we remove the screen guard, then it costs around 1k for new one. Amazon supports just refused to replace this product and adviced me to visit nearest oneplus store.

  VERDICTDisplay - 9/10Performance - 10/10Battery - 10/10Charging - 10/10Sound & Haptics - 9/10Camera - 8/10Software - 10/10Overall - 9.5/10GO FOR THE 12GB variant. For just an extra 3k, you get 4 GB additional RAM & 128 GB additional storage. They have priced the top variant extremely well and offers excellent value over the base variant.This is my review after 8 days of use ( I bought mine on the very 1st day of sale - 16th):I am a long time user of OnePlus devices, so I knew what to expect. Oxygen OS is the best version of Android even today. However, is unfortunate that OnePlus has started bundling a few unwanted stuff in their software.Those are as follows:1. Login with OnePlus account/  Red Cable Club (RCC) - This is present in the Indian devices and cannot be removed. I don't know why they want to force it upon us.2. OnePlus Cloud - A cloud service which may be useful for some, but forcing it on everyone is unacceptable. A big 'Sign in to Cloud' box shows on your face in the Gallery app and cannot be removed. Very annoying.3. Zen Mode - deeply integrated with the system. This is in addition to the default Digital Wellbeing app.4. Preinstalled apps like Netflix (cannot be uninstalled), OnePlus Buds, Amazon, and a handful of others. These can, however be uninstalled.5. CAMERAS - This is the only disappointment from hardware point of view. Instead of giving the macro and monochrome lenses, they should have given a telephoto lens. That would have been much more useful. I am fine without IP68 & wireless charging.6. in-display Fingerprint scanner is a bit glitchy. Often fails to register/ read fingerprint properly. I think this is a software issue and can be fixed with an update.Pros1. No Facebook services pre-installed. After backlash in the community for installing that in the Nord devices, they acted wisely by removing it and not including it in the 8T.2. Display is great with 120Hz AMOLED. I don't have the black crush/ green tint issue.3. Charging - The most unique part of this phone. Super fast charging. I usually put it on charge when the battery is around 20% and it fully charges under 40 minutes.4. Battery life is great. I have consistently got over 6 hours of screen-on-time everyday. I charge around 20%, so if I push it, I know I can get about 8 hours SOT. But it is NOT advisable to let the battery charge drop below 15%.5. OOS is fluid and super fast. RAM management is great too. With 12GB RAM, I don't have to worry about it. There are a few minor software bugs, and I hope the company would fix them soon. Nothing that would make for a poor user experience though.6. I don't have any heating issues. The phone gets warm to the touch when doing video calls, and that is normal.7. Gaming is great and no lags or any issues. I must say I haven't played too much except for testing purposes.8. Speakers are great with nice haptic feedback. Dolby Atmos is included, but I didn't find any improvement with it. Hopefully they will allow that to be tweaked more in future updates.9. Call quality and network reception/ connectivity are all great.10. Face unlock is superfast.If you are into photography and need best cameras on your phone, this is NOT for you. Even the Samsung Galaxy S20FE has better cameras at a similar price point. Other than that, this is the best phone under 50k if you are okay with no wireless charging/ IP68.Please note that I am NOT saying that the camera is bad. Just that it is not the best, and I wish they had included a telephoto lens. You can take very good pictures and Nightscape is amazing.

I'm sure through updates it will improve!-battery it's super fast thanks to 65w charger !-The haptic's  in this device is well balanced and it is well pronounced!-Design and in hand feel is just amazing.Cons:-Camera (it's a con for those who want the bestest camera out there...and this is simply not the best)-No IP rating-No wireless charging (which I couldn't care less)

  It is an absolute beast. The aquamarine green looks amazing in the real world. In the box, you'll receive the handset, the famous red cable, and a 65 watt power adapter along with Sim ejector tool, back cover, oneplus stickers and guides.While using the phone in real life, there will be 0 lag, excellent RAM management, and excellent battery life.The charging is blazing fast and that's what we expect from this 65 watt charger.I have charged the phone to 100% on Monday 2 PM and my battery is at 32% on Tuesday 10AM while writing this review. To tell you the truth, I have never experienced this kind of battery backup previously.I have played few games like FIFA and COD and they were smooth as butter.The phone produces excellent color and brightness. Tested the camera on some subjects, and I am very happy with the camera performance so far.Overall, this phone is a beast and it will definitely change your day to day experience. Gamers will definitely like this phone as there are no heating issues while playing and 120hz refresh rate makes everything very smooth.This is an early review and I think it's safe to say that this phone is not going to disappoint.This is the end. Good day everyone. Bye.

  Purchased One Plus 8T on the first day of launch & after using 9 days, quite excited to share my experience. This phone is a masterpiece in terms of spec & performance.I have upgraded from OP6 which I used almost 2 yrs but have no regret of switching to it.It's latest Snapdragon 865 processor with Fluid Amoled, 120Hz refresh rate display is amazing on this phone. All 4 Main Cameras are really awesome & specially that super macro feature is superb. Battery life is agreat it can last to a day after a long usage. Best part is the 65W fast charging which is truly amazing.. I can able to charge completely it in 30-40 mins.. Now I'm a fan of One Plus with this beauty..

  I have purchased this phone with 12gb Ram & 256gb storage, it's also available with 8gb varient. Oneplus T version phone are always good. Oneplus 8 or 8pro has some display and heating issue but this is goodGood part1. Phone charging is very very fast. Charge in 30-40min to 100%2. Decent camera3. It comes with phone cover and temperad glass4. This phone looks like premium quality.5. Snapdragon 865 processor <U+0001F60D>Bad part1. I feel this phone little hot during transferring the phone date from old phone to this one. But it's not all the time. Now it's working well.2. Camera could have been little better. Oneplus need to workon it. Samsung S20 FE has better camera.If someone do not want to buy this phone then I will suggest them.Samsung S20 FE or Mi10T ProThese set are with same range and almost same configuration.I did't not go with Samsung S20FE beacuse it has shitty processor which is octa-core Samsung Exynos 990.

  I m planning to buy iphone 11 but after launching 8t I decided to buy 8t because of display, charging speed, performance, higher internal storage for lower price.Pros1.amazing screen without any issues2. battery, SOT is above 8 hrs3. Performance4. Camera with great photos and great night mode-  I was using gcam and sd865 processing is great for gcam and stock camera photos also.5. Front camera also good6. Oxygen os 117. Charging- 15 to 100% in 32 minutesCons.1. Price is little bit higher. If they priced under 40k then it will be great deal.Verdict:If you want allrounder phone definitely go for it of 256gb variant because if you use this phone long term usage then definitely need high storage.

  Well you must already know the specifications of this device by now and this device is a beast.it took me less than 3 min to download and install around 40 appsi would suggest you go with the 12gb RAM variant120Hz display is butter smooth and you do notice the difference between a 60hz and a 120hz displayI was a little skeptical about the camera performance but if you are not a photographer  this camera is more than enough for youBattery life is pretty goodIt will easily last you for a day but keep in mind that this is not a two days deviceCharging speed is just unreal it charges to 100% in 45 min which is insaneConnectivity A+ no issues thereJust one concern- they should have given the type-c to 3.5mm dongleso just go for itits a great deal

  Received on 18th Oct 2020. 1+2, 1+3,1+5,1+6t n now 1+8t. Oxygen OS is too good and never had any reason to switch to any other brands.Battery back up is good for a day.Considered Mi10t pro but only good thing about that phone may be that 108mp camera.Stuck to 1+ mainly coz of the almost stock android experience.Built quality is good, stereo speakers now sound excellent, volume is adequate.Always on display is a boon.Camera quality is good for daily photography n all. If I need dslr quality photos, I would use a Dslr.Charging is lighting fast with new 65w charger.This is definitely not a flagship model but it was a good phone to upgrade from 6T.Sold off my back up iPhone 6S as exchange for 1+8t <U+0001F606>. If any queries, drop me a message. Will update after further usage.

  This phone is very powerful which is clearly evident from its spec-list.Let me give some pros and cons after around a week of of usePros:* Great display (120 Hz is buttery smooth)*Flagship processor (SD 865). No lag whatsoever* Oxygen OS* Good battery easily lasting for 1.5 days*Fast charging speed is crazy (charging 0 to 100% in 40 mins) and no the phone doesn't get hot while the charger heats up a bit which is expected*I didn't observe any significant heating while playing games*Solid build - Aluminum frame with glass back.*5G (although it will only useful in the future)*Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1* 48 MP Main camera and wide angle camera is very good*Included case is goodCons:*I didn't like the 2MP micro camera and the chromatic camera (should have given a telephoto)

  I have moved from iOS to Android and trust me to have this beast during the transition phase is an absolute pleasure. Display is amazing, 120 hgz refresh rate really does the job in terms of your viewing experience going to the next level. I don't play games but usually keep on checking emails,chats etc as part of work and this is much better than an iPhone where in entire day was spent on charging the phone. Camera is superb as well. To sum up its indeed is a great buy.

  A great phone at this price. The back main camera pictures are nice but they should improve the front camera specially provide night mode. Battery life is good and last throughout the day. It gets a little warm sometimes, note I don't play heavy games much and there is a hollow feeling at the back of the phone when speakers are on. But overall I'm happy with my decision and the performance of the phone is undoubtedly great.

  This is not a ranting review, it's friendly advice that would save you some money and time.I was using Oneplus 6 before upgrading to Oneplus 8T. Of course, wanted to experience that improved performance and high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate that everyone is talking about.But, the problem with Oneplus 8T is the display itself. First of all, if you are getting Oneplus 8T, you gonna have screen issues straight out of the box.Reference keywords for your Google research:- Oneplus Purple Tint- Oneplus Black Crush- Oneplus GhostingMine was Purple Tint.Remember those old phones we used to use 8 years back that had this poorly made screens which looked sharp from the front but when you tilt it to a certain extent all the colours get washed?Same happening here when I keep my phone brightness under 30%.Secondly, the screen brightness is like an old tube light. When you increase or decrease your screen brightness using the toggle in the notification panel, it will take some time to respond to the change.For example: if I increase my brightness from 30% to 70%, it will take a good half-second to respond to that change. Increasing brightness on this device is not instant on this device is all I am saying.Sadly, the phone at this price point can't even keep up with the competition when it comes to the screen quality.Lastly, I would highly recommend reading some Google reviews before buying this product.

  I ordered it within 10 seconds of opening of the sale and received delivery on very next day. No issue in delivery. But it seems expensive and over priced. One plus 8 is more impressive in looks and more sleek. One plus 8t disappointed me in matter of looks, overall performance is ok but it drain bettery very fast  no doubt charger is very fast.Nothing new in it and at this price tag people expect more inovative but this time OnePlus disappointed me because of looks, thickness and body finish of oneus 8t. I am not happy with this purchase.

  This is my first experience with one plus which is not good at all. Initially whhen the phone was delivered i was prtty kuch excited but as I strt to install stuff n set up my google ac n all the phone strtd to heat up. I put it on charge it heated up prtty bad. Okay so does any new phone gts heated up on the 1st day itself? I was very disappointed . I contacted Amazon customers service thy sent a tchnician at my plce , he said the phone doesn't have any issue . I didn't have any other choice left then to use it.I would rate my experience till now- Battery - 3.5/5 ( battry backup is not good at all)Camera- 4.5/5Speed- 4/5Sound -4.5/5Screen qualify -4/5The only issue is that it heats up very fast n vry bad. While playin not so heavy games it heats up. While charging it heats up prtty bad.Overall i would say i expxtd much more at this price from one plus. Its would make an awesome phne if there was no heating issues.

  I have been using the Oneplus 8T for a week now and the experience has been good. A lot of consumers might be confused between buying the 8 and 8T because they are so similarly priced. I will, however, give you my perspective as to why I did not go with the 8 or 8 Pro. To start with, both have curved displays, which as you may know are fragile. Though I won't call myself a rough user, I have dropped my phones a few times.  Accidents happen!According to Oneplus India's official site, the following are the prices for replacing a damaged screen on 8 series phones:8 - <U+20B9>13,5008T - <U+20B9>13,7008 Pro - <U+20B9>16,300The 8T comes with a 120Hz screen, compared to the 90Hz on the 8 and 8 Pro. Can you notice the difference between a 90 and 120Hz display panel? I don't know. I used the Oneplus 3T before this. Compare the 3T with the 8T and the latter feels like a massive upgrade. The 6.55 inches Fluid AMOLED display gives you a very pleasant experience while watching Prime or YouTube videos.  The 120Hz refresh rate makes day to day multitasking a breeze. Since the time I have had this, I haven't even once connected my phone to my Bluetooth speaker because the audio experience is good and loud with the dual stereo speakers. The display has HDR10+ support. The screen is extremely bright even when viewed under direct sunlight. Not to mention the 8 Pro has display issues as reported by a lot of users. I have found no issues with the display in my use with the 8T so far.With the T variants before, Oneplus used to push the limit and go with the 'plus' processor, but they haven't this time, which I felt was slightly disappointing. I have seen speed tests between the 8T and Asus ROG 3, which comes with the SD865+. There were minor differences between themSince the phone ships with latest Android 11 and Oxygen OS 11, I felt the software experience could have been better and more tuned since there were a lot of bugs in the UI, which I hope will be fixed. Oneplus has been known to provide great software support to all their devices, so you know you are covered on that side.I used the Oneplus 3T for almost 4 years before this and I do agree that Oneplus  cameras aren't really close to the ones on the Samsung, Apple and Pixel devices. The AI or computational photography features like nightscape/night-mode on today's smartphones are decent at best. If you have handled a DSLR like me and know the basics of photography, you can click some really good pictures with this device. The macro and monochrome cameras weren't really necessary, Oneplus should have gone with the Telephoto lens instead.Even with the 65W charging the phone doesn't heat as much as my 3T, thanks to its vapor chamber cooling system. I wish, Oneplus would have provided us with features like Scheduled, Slow and by-pass charging to increase the longevity of a our batteries.Pro-Tip: If you want to make your phone even more snappier, turn off the animations by enabling the developer mode in the settings. Also, the Lunar Silver variant looks sexy.  Take a look at the pictures.

  This review is from a normal user, a working personal. Best useful feature for me is fast charging. Amoled display is noticeably better than IPS LCD. Camera is surely better than most phones under 30k. Phone is very fast. And phone speakers are very loud and clear. Audio quality is also superb. Most importantly if you're just a normal user who mainly use phone for calls, checking social media, occasionally clicking snaps then I don't suggest to buy expensive phone. 20k phones are enough for that kind of usage. High spec phones are for hard-core users and gamers.

  This is my first one plus device and I mus say I am impressed. I have received this device on 18th oct and have been using this for past 7 days. Here are my two cents-Pros-1. Buttery smooth performance. 120hz is a treat2.Fluid amoled display- great colors and contrast3. Camera is pretty good in day light conditions and there are ample settings available including pro mode (f1.7 aperture)4.Charging speed is phoenamenal. Love the warp charge 65Cons:1. While setting up the device, phone did get quite heated and os gave warning. It basically happened during app transfer from my old device. Although after that even during charging I never saw temperature going above 40. With normal to heavy usage it remains under 40 degrees which is good.2. Low light camera performance is noisy.although with nightscape one can take decent photos.3. Few apps such as Kotak Mahindra are not working on android 11/oxygen 11With that being said I didn't notice anything else- no black crush,green tint or purple tint/banding. All good. In this price segment, it is well justified phone.

   A great handset from OnePlus again!Pros:Warp Charging - 0-100 in 35-40minFlat DisplayPerformance with SD 865Very good sound qualityVideo stabilization is awesome!Cons:Playstore is having some issues while downloading some specific apps. Those apps are not getting installed. Many users have reported it. They will fix it next update mostly.Battery backup is average. 5-6 hours SOT in 120Hz refresh rate.Camera is just above average. Night mode is good.

  The aquamarine green looks better than images. The display is butter smooth, I also have a Poco x2 which has 120hz smoothness is better than poco in this phone. Sd 865 handles each and every task easily no stutters at all even on pubg with hdr extreme.Haptic motor is also very good just like OnePlus 8 pro.Camera is great but not the best in this price range.Phone doesn't heat up while charging at 65w btw it fully charges in 38-39 minutes.Stereo speaker is also very good. Display is color accurate. Overall it is killer in this price... And feels premiumAnd the back is not fingerprint magnet its quite nice...  I would prefer you to buy aquamarine green.

  One plus just loosing it's image. This is my first one plus phone and I got disappointed from this. Lots of software issues I am facing from this phone.Camera quality is just like a 20k phone. Battery is very much poor , do not last for atleast a single day. It must be around 5500 mah with this drainage of battery. I am unable to update one plus gallery, everytime is shows software error.Can't use stock android experience. Where the hell is oxygen OS, its very poor. My older vivo nex was far better in terms of software and UI.Call recording function not available, I can't understand simply 10k phones now a days have it.IMX 586 is outdated still they are using it in T version. One plus Nord and this device got almost same primary camera. My 2nd SIM is running on 4G or not, it is not showing. The same DDR4 , atleast this can be improved. What is meaning of T version.Camera 6/10.Battery 5/10Display 8/10Performance 9/10Software and UI 4/10Charging 10/10

  This OP8T is beast. Overall every of your single task, multi task, camera performance, gaming and everything is best in it.. most of all I'm game lover, loved to play pubg in it..<U+0001F60D> You'll never get disappointed by this beast.. I've come along from Samsung A50.. I've seen a lots of changes, the 120hz display gives you the buttery smooth while scrolling news feed or using any of the system. Just in love with this flagship killer device.Snapdragon 865 just killing it.. you won't get enough in other.. just go for it blindly..<U+0001F970> mine took only 5 days to arrive at my place and I'm happy with it.. device's mind blowing..

  Right of the bat, I would like to list the slightly bad thing about the phone which is pretty much the camera. It does the job though. It's a pretty decent camera which will practically do anything you might want to do in your day to day use. If you just want to professionally shoot pictures, just buy a camera.Now that the camera is out of the way, I think there is nothing where OnePlus is lacking. The display is absolutely gorgeous (and it's FLAT). The bezels are thin and sweet. The performance is absolutely crushing any other phone in this range (at par with the flagships). The feel of the phone in the hand and looks are just great. The 120Hz feels very smooth. And finally, the Oxygen OS is gorgeous.I would say if you are looking for a phone which has the best camera, this is not it. But if you are okay with a decent camera, this phone is an absolute beast everywhere else.

  Pros; Performance & Battery life is very impressive.Cons; Very Low standard Camera in this price point specially the Selfie camera,in low light conditions its like low range oppo vivo selifie. As u can see in my uploaded images, Unnatural  tones and added colours,where as the rear camera is a bit acceptable.as a whole in this price point ans segment Cameras Could have been improved.Even older 6T camera selfie is far better than 8T

  Satisfied with the Phone Build Quality, Charging Speed, Display, Battery Backup and you name it. Camera quality is good and I have seen some videos comparing it with Samsung S20FE and iPhone 11. Those mobile costs 6k more than OnePlus 8T and camera quality difference is negligible. Of course FT and 11 does better job in some condition but in some OnePlus 8T is best. Instead of Macro and Monochrome in 8T they could have went with Telephoto lens but hey you cant have all right configuration in a smartphone and if it does people wont buy OnePlus 8 or OnePlus 8Pro. The main camera sensor used in OnePlus8T is same as OnePlus 7 till OnePlus 8Pro. so that's 2 year old hardware but its best at what it is.  Anyway there is always GCam mod and you can use that to take pics. Worth the Price. Go for it.

  Extra ordinary on one side, terrible on the other.Pros:1. Good display with 120 Hz sceeen. Simply stunning.2. Super fast processor and OS. Though Android 11 has some glitches, I'm sure OP will fix them soon.3. Aesthetically designed well, weight distribution is uniform & handling the phone is way easier thanks to the flat screen.4. Load speaker is good though the bottom speaker is loader making the steteo experience little awkward at times. But never mind, they're good.5. The haptic feedback of the vibration motar is good and feels premium6. Build quality is top notch. The camera bump looks way better in reality than in the picturesCons1. Oh god, what a horrible camera. It's pathetic. I previously used OP6 and felt even that 3 year old phone does a similar job at clicking below par pictures.2. Why make a glass phone if you don't want to include wireless charging. Specially in 2020, at 46k? Its like spending money on an expensive suit and not buy shoes but wear flip flops! HuhConclusion: it's a decent phone but I feel OP got it all wrong with the pricing and features of their 3 phones. The Nord, regular and the pro series. The OP Pro at almost 14k more expensive than the regular isn't worth it for what it offers. But again, is the One plus regular worth over the nord at almost 20k premium? 765G processor is just as good is what I've heard. If you can wait, please don't buy 8T or 8 Pro. Wait for 9.Dear OP, instead of cutting down on \"not so expensive stuff\" on your regular versions, please try to create something new for your Pro versions that would make them worthy of buying.q

  Being used to OnePlus family of devices right from the One to Five to now 8T, it's been a journey of change, bigger screens, fast to ultra fast charging, however the camera could've been better!+120Hz is slick, you may not want to go back to 60Hz+Warp charge 65 is blazing fast, and the bottom doesn't heat up as well+Display is nice and pleasing+Droid 11 out of the box, however Oxygen OS has the biggest change by deviating from stock Android to customisations (some would like it while some wouldn't)+Buttery smooth OS, works like a charm-Some customisations are really good use-battery lasts for a day and more based on usage, but with the warp charge, you never run out of power+Cooling system is too good, you never feel too much heat even after long hours of use or gaming+Always on is a nice feature and I love the Canvas-Camera is good but nothing evolutionary, OP needs to work in this areas on hardware rather than always tweaking the algorithms-Some apps are not customized to 120Hz refresh and may act weird-OS design seems to be heavily influenced from Samsung, OP can do better on their own and do good-Elegant design nevertheless, nothing groundbreaking-Might feel a tad heavy for someLastly,Aquamarine green looks lovely in the hand, worth picking it up over the SilverOp7t users and above can wait for Op9

  Here is the review of my own device.Starting with the screen-1. Beautiful amoled panel with accurate colours.2. 120hz display is lit.3. Brightness goes really high, didn't face any problem while using on direct sunlight.4. Flat screen is more secure than curve.Performance-1. Snapdragon 865, lag free experiences.2. In Day to day use, no problem.Camera -1. Sony imx586 is here, pictures are lil more saturated.2. Nightscape is great.3. Video quality is good enough and stable too.Looks n feel-1. This have glass back so its too slippery. (Use protective case, use soft case)2. The colour aquamarine green is sick. This one is glossy. My friend bought the lunar silver one, that's matte finish.Summary-Great performance, good enough camera and the 65watt charge is also fast it takes max 44-45min to charge 0-100% . *Oneplus give software update fast to upgrade ta camera quality*

  I was very confused between lots of phones be it One Plus 8T or Samsung S20+, Samsung S20 FE or iphone 11 during the sale this diwali.It was really tough to choose but I am happy that I chose OnePlus 8T.Why did I choose OnePlus and why it was better than buying Iphone 11 or Samsung S20+ for me?1. Future reday with 5G : I know 5G will take some time to hit india but I wanted that piece of mind that even if it comes early, I would not be left behind or I wouldn't have to rush to buy a phone.2. Battery and charging : i do a lot of my office work on email , whatsapp or teams and have a very high screen time. I do not have a lot of time during day to charge my phone . Obeplus comes with a charger that charges this mobile in like 45 minutes and the battery backup is also great.3. Processor and heating : I had my doubts on Samsung Exynos so Snapdragon 865 next best to apple bionic. No heating and smooth performance..4. Great display : 120 HZ vs Apple iphone 11 was a big deal for me.i had yo experience this myself and oh boy this is like buttery smooth.5. Design : the build quality is top notch and premium finishCamera output especially night mode shots are great. I can't say better than Samsung or apple as I have not used them but anyways camera was not my first preference while buying phone so that's also ok for me.Overall if you are looking for a great allrounder device, a device for your heavy duty day to day usage please go with OnePlus 8T.

  It is my first OnePlus device. What a brilliant device it is.Pros I found:1) Very good build quality. Feels very premium in hand.2) The screen is super smooth.3) Performance is awesome.4 ) Very good battery life. I'm a normal user and I'm getting around 1 day.The charging speed is just super fast.5) Camera is descent. I don't buy phones expecting a dslr camera quality. A descent camera is ok for me. If u want best camera buy a dedicated camera.6) Oxygen OS is clean and butter smooth. Loved it!7) Alot of customizations.8) I use a type c to 3.5mm adapter to connect my headphones. I must say the sound output is just awesome.Cons:1) The camera department. It's descent. If you are expecting a best camera then it is not. They are giving new updates to improve it.No more cons I can think of.And few more things I must say. I think many got the device as a gift. Because they are complaining for something which was already there.-> The product details clearly says it has no headphone jack. And I see people complaining about headphone jack.-> Most reviewers said camera is descent only.-> The screen is 120hz. So it will drain some battery. Still it's not bad. Can survive a day easily with normal use. And you are getting a 65w warp charger.-> For those who are telling there are better devices than this at this price range, seriously you know this before buying right?Afterall whichever devices you select, it won't match a OnePlus and the feel it gives.

  I bought it on the 1st day of the Great Indian Festival. Posting this review after using it for 1 week.1. Amazing Display: The 120Hz display makes it super smooth.(I was previously using Red Magic 3 which had a 90 Hz display. I can say the difference is visible)2. Good Battery Life: Its 2020, lets agree all phones it this range are coming with big battery. The battery(4500 mah) is decent enough to take you through your day considering the amazing 120 hz refresh is always on. Again the amazing fast charging always keeps you going within 10 mins of charging.3. Camera: I won't say its the best camera out there but its really good. As OnePlus has been using the same camera for the past some versions of Oneplus flagships, shows up that refinement in picture quality.4. Performance: There is no complaints here, the SD 865 paired with 8 GB & that refresh ratio, you can expect everything to be fluid be it watching videos, playing high end games, scrolling etc5. Build Quality is also pretty good.6. Good to have all latest - wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, Ufs 3.1

  Its been a week since am using oneplus 8T. And am facing issue from the very beginning. I had to format my phone 3 times within a week because of the issues in it after being told to do so by the customer care. First my gmail was not working. 2nd time there was problem in the play store where it was crashing again and again. 3rd time there was problem with the network where suddenly my phone stopped receiving incoming call nor i was able to do outgoing calls than i had to restart my phone that it worked and this happened atleast 2 times a day so i has to reset the network settings. Now am not able to download apps from play store which are higher than 200mb. I have attached the screenshot of the error it is showing. Now they are saying to wait for the next update because as per them this is the issue with many users, and till then i cant download apps bigger than 200 mb from playstore.This was my experience with this device . Totally disappointed and I suggest all not to buy this phone at all. Oneplus is no longer a flagship killer.

If you want 5G and 65W charger then please go for it you never disappoint or regret for this device.

  Classic Oneplus product as you'd expect from a flagship killer aka non flagship device.1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7t, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.5 Camera: It's good for the price, but when you look at the competition, pixel and S20FE, they have better cameras. Not saying it's bad just it falls behind the competition in this price segment. It's the only weak part of this phone because the rest all things of this phone are soo good that this camera system makes itself visible as a potential weakness in it. Still though it's a good camera.Honorable mentions : Dear ONEPLUS, I've been a fan from the first phone you have launched and I've personally used it which is the one plus one and I've used many other oneplus phones after that and there after many of my family members and friends began to buy considering the value you provide for the amount we are paying. But there are certain things which has to be mandatory if you consider any phone a flagship i.e wireless charging and a proper IP rating.Personally this is a major draw back of the phone considering its competition, the S20FE has both and many people may go for samsung just because of those 2 reasons which adds to the durability of the phone. Hope you hear me out and include those 2 major check points in the coming models.

  Was waiting to upgrade from 3T and since was happy finally upgraded to 8T.Pretty decent and working as expected for 3 days of usage , Wrap charge is big change seriously Full charge in less than 1 hr and good  battery backup. Pretty decent photos and macro mode.Sound is good as you have stereo speakers.The display and refresh speed you can see a considerable improvement.At last you can blindly get this phone.

  Phone is good in all the features, Liked it a lot till now except the Battery Backup is not at all good if you are a continuous user of Mobile for complete whole day, you need to charge it twice/thrice a day..Rest everything is fine, Charging speed is really nice.. But never expected this low level of Battery Backup.. Disappointed <U+0001F615>Some other problems as well encountered after using it for 4 days..Not at all expected from one plus<U+0001F64F>

  I read lot of reviews and all but it's my opinionWhat I like:- It's the fastest charging I've seen (0-100 less than 40 min)- Signal reception(Data speeds), I don't about how Apple, Samsung or any other flagships handle this (but one plus nailed it)(well I'm only talking about 4G, don't know about 5G).- Camera (Lot of people saying there are better options for me it's more than enough, Well I'm not a camera freak)- Display is good(don't know whether it's the best, but if it's in 120Hz mode battery is draining faster Currently I'm using 60Hz mode I'm getting almost a full day(12-18hrs screen time) in 60, but not in 120 it around 6-8 hrs screen time).What I dont like:- Weight- I actually like smaller screens but yeah I can adjust with it.- It's heating (I'm not sure about the measurements but I can feel that heat) when browsing a lot, downloading big files, the hotspot, little gaming(coc), and charging (In the youtube reviews they're saying it's fine but for me I don't feel like it's fine.)

  Technically my fourth one plus phone (I even had the first one plus 1 not in pic). But this time it's been a let down :( .With the high refresh rates I think the phone is not able to handle the low resolution videos. There is a lot of noise in the videos. Tested on insta, YouTube, Facebook. Even tried removing the screen guard with no improvement. Not sure if this can be corrected by software.The screen is big even though narrow and one needs to use both hands playing around.Pros:Charging is fast and camera is good. And high resolution videos good.

  Everything is great about the phone except the heating issue. It became quite hot during initial setup and remains warm on normal usage also all the time at the top railing and around camera.I have installed CPU Z and Cpu monitor appns and saw a constant cpu temp of 42 to 50 °C and battery temperature of upto 40°CHave requested Amazon technician checkup!

  I really liked the device. Here are few of my findings.Pros:1. Battery Backup is better than expected. Last more than a day with normal usage.2. Hdr10+ and 120hz makes the display perfect.3. Network connectivity is better because of 5g support.4. Good looking Design and phone feels good in hand.5. Fast charging is a real time saver. I used op5 and this device charges significantly faster than that.6. Sound quality and loudness is apt. Stereo speakers are good enough for normal media consumption.Cons:1. Prime and Netflix doesn't support full screen and hdr as yet which kind of ruins the experience.2. Cameras could have been better. Although Nightscape mode is good.Overall it's a great device if you like flat display else go for op8.

  Buy only if you have older model of phones. Warp charging is really blazing fast. Sound quality is excellent. Nothing looks practically new with 120hz refresh rate or Oxygen OS11 based on Android 11. I was already using OnePlus 7 and hence don't feel any major update in OnePlus 8T.On the contrary, I am unable to publish anything on OnePlus community as the phone gets hanged while publishing post. Also I can't update OnePlus Gallery app in play Store as all the time it  says there is some problem in update.Features like variety of navigation gestures, sms category byfurcation are much more better in OnePlus 7 than this phone. Hopefully OnePlus restores these features in OTA updates soon..

  Bought Aqua Marine model, This is my first experience with One Plus device, and I have really been disappointed so far, the phone heats up on regular calls, while playing music and other stuffs, the battery drain is very bad. I am getting maximum screen on time of 4hrs.With 4500mAh battery I expected a lot more. This is acting like a 10-15k phone, even those phone do not heat so easily nowadays. Main Camera is Good same as Nord.The display at 120hz is the only plus point, speaker is also good, two cameras are just for show you can cover the two lenses and still take the Macro Photos with the main sensor.I will probably return the phone I am very disappointed. While writing this review the phone has started heating up.Also to mention it's very hectic task to get the phone returned. Bad bad experience with both Amazon and OnePlus 8TI have also shared the battery drain screenshots. Hope it helps to other shoppers.

  This review is about the big blunder done by Oneplus and Amazon.I ordered the 12 gb RAM variant on Oct 17 and received the 8 gb RAM variant on Oct 19. I immediately notified Amazon support and they agreed that wrong item has been sent. I asked them for replacement and they said that product is out of stock, I can add it to wishlist and once I get notified that it's available, I should call them and request for replacement. So, they delegated their job to me.It became available again in the evening of Oct 19, so I called them back and asked them to order the replacement as I wasn't able to do it on my own. I was kept on hold for 15 minutes and then told to disconnect as the team wasn't available.I called them again after some time and then the service executive said that he is unable to, but his leads and managers will create a replacement request in next 1-2 minutes. Those 2 minutes never ended and I was on the call with them for more than an hour which again ended in disappointment as his so called manager was also unable to create the replacement. In the end he told me to return the device and order a new one. I asked him will I get the same offers and discounts to which he blatantly lied saying yes. But when I checked the discounts were already down from <U+20B9>1,750 to <U+20B9>1,500.I also told him that I can't use my HDFC card again and the device quantity is also limited to 1 unit per account, he advised me to either select a different color or borrow card from a friend and use another account. I was really surprised with such a fabulous piece of advice from the best customer centric company in the world.Then I asked him to escalate as he was straight away lying and trying to get rid of me, but to my surprise the next level executive also had next level IQ. She told me if I'm ready to accept the wrong variant she'll go over and beyond to compensate. I asked her what can she do, she said she'll ask her leads and call me back in 15 minutes.She did called after 15 minutes to say that we'll refund <U+20B9>700 to your Amazon pay account if I keep the 128 gb variant. I don't know how she calculated that difference maybe using a Amazon designed cheater calculator. Everyone can see the there is a difference of <U+20B9>3,000 in 256 gb and 128 gb variants, but she said \"no sir, this amount is too huge for us to process\".I again gathered courage and asked her not to converse with me further and again escalate the issue. She said I'll get a call back in 24-48 hours but at the time of writing this review I've not received any calls from Amazon.Yesterday, I got an email saying that a team is working on it and need 4 working days to resolve. After committing the blunder and 3 hours of calls with the customer, they still need time.I did trust Amazon and have never faced any issues in past 5 years I've been associated with them, but this time they have really disappointed me. I accept the fact that mistakes do happen in a large supply chain but even after accepting they are not ready to do anything. The customer support executives are lying, harassing customers by making them wait longer, copy pasting standard email replies where they don't even edit the customer's name, one of the executives addressed me as \"Saleem\". So, yes their customer support is surely going downhill.I do request you all to not blindly trust these support executives for your own good. Be vigilant about the products that you order and receive.

  I've been waiting for this phone's release from one month because I didn't want to buy One Plus 8 because of the curved display and..I was not disappointed...-*Display* is awesome...better than one plus 8 because I've heard that they've improved the brightness levels-*120Hz Refresh rate*....although 90hz is more than enough but in gaming and some other areas 120hz will be usefull...-*4500mah battery* is enough for our daily usage but ...you know 120hz will drain the battery faster when compared with 60hz and 90hz ..but you'll get 5-6 hours screen time easily in 120hz too-*65W charging*...woah full charging in less than 45 min ... I've kept charging at 1:10am at 18% and started surfing Instagram by the time 1:50am it was 99%..lol..-*Cameras*... I've shared some samples.. pls don't judge by those photo's because I've captured those pics 5mim before writing this review only..but they came pretty good..those were just clicked casually..but if you use them properly you'll get better pics..and they've improved the camera software and Ive heard it is better than one plus 8... they've improved ultra wide and macro camera also-*Oxygen OS*..you know Oxygen OS is awesome..I've upgraded from MiUI and I can find so much difference..no ads at all and clean software..no blotware...they have even removed Facebook lol..only Google apps and Amazon were pre installed...You can even buy oneplus phones for Oxygen OS only..it is that good-*Gaming*.. Snapdragon 865 will handle almost every game pretty well.. battery drain is also less while I'm playing Pubg and other games-Phone is very good looking and very comfortable to carry  Finally I'm happy with my purchase and specs wise it is better than OnePlus 8..But it is your wish because some feel curved display are more premium so if you like curved display you can take one plus 8..but if you're ok with any type of screen then you should definitely pick 8T over 8 ....because 8T has better specs in almost every aspect

  I rarely write reviews but this time I thought I need to share my experience, I was little disappointed to see how Indian audience get influenced by tech reviewers (especially the USA one). They are comparing a device which is launched $100 more to an Indian pricing so there experience will be totally different considering the price point.In India it is for almost $540 dollars. In this price range I don't think we will get any better value. Very good phone with an above average camera, if you're clicking for social media then in 95% of the cases all the high-end camera looks same. Software experience is surreal; Almost similar like pixel.Pixel 5  and 4A 5G is not available in India plus Google mobile strategy sucks in IndiaSamsung FE is 130 dollars more than 8T. I was using S9 and believe me after 7-8 months Samsung phones start lagging. They force you to use their crappySamsung play store. Samsung software is really pain some time.iPhone 12 - Damm expensive in an Indian market, Price difference from an International pricing is insane.Apparently Yes, They are doing to much marketing with their camera system. 2 lenses are crap but overall its a very capable Cam plus if we get the GCAM for 8T. BOOM.Under 550$ this is the best value a consumer can get in an Indian market.I am using this device for the last 6 days - No heating issues (I didn't use for gaming purpose), No blue or red tint on screen, Sound quality is good but it's just you feel little vibration at back when u play songs at max volume - I reckon its common in stereo speakers because i felt the same in other devices also.P.S: Not a 1+ fan, never used their devices as my regular daily drivers (previously I was using Galaxy S8/S9 and believe me it feels 3X faster to those phones) but this is the company which is really hearing their customer (especially in India) Cheers!

   1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS 11, which runs as smooth as they come.2) SUPER AMOLED screen and 120Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above best.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is best.7) Phone Charging is mind blowing. Need just 40 min to Full charge.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is Very very fast.10) The camera is good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera is awesome. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording1080@60fps performance is good. (The camera is better than most phones out there)11) No headphone jack.12) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio is well delivered on a stereo speaker.413) No expandable memory slot.14) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen is as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.

  I got it on16th October via one day delivery.So after using 3 days I am writing this review.As far as the display, it is very smooth we can really feel the difference between 60hz screen & 120hz screen. We can easily look at the screen clearly even in the sunlight, thanks to one plus for increasing brightness nits upto 1090. So display is very smooth, you will love it.Also, the latest processor SD865 performs very good. I played COD Mobile. The experience was awesome. Gaming was smooth. It also comes with Game Space that allows us to play games peacefully. While gaming or charging it heats a little but which is negligible as temp. (39-41 deg. Celcius) is very low as compared to other devices.Camera is very good. But there is not latest sensor. If provided it could be great. But difference is noticable only when you zoom image to final level or you are a camera freak.It is almost as good as OP8, I have to say a little better than OP8. But not better than OP8 Pro. But a normal person like me who uses camera occasionally, it does not make any difference.I prefer latest processor and display.It also includes Oxygen OS & Android 11 out of the box which makes it again more interesting due to its awesome features.And this all comes at a price of 42999/- only.I got it for 39000/- at AGIF Sale.So it is a great deal at 42999/-.

  Ordered a week back. No complaints till now. Battery backup and optimization is awesome and lasts for over a day. I just charge for 10 minutes in a day and even if I play battery draining games, the battery lasts for over 24 hrs. Android 11 is also awesome. Getting used to the new features. No lag till now. Frame rate is also high. Everything is smooth.Just one thing that I wish it had was a headphone/earphone jack and a earphone packaged into the box. I don't know if Oneplus will (in future) add back the headphone jack. But nowadays, all phone companies are removing it. So, not something related to just this company.

  The phone is my first Oneplus device and it has impressed me quite well. The display is beautiful and crisp. The phone feels sturdy and easy to hold after putting on the delivered plain case. Opening apps are a breeze and the UI is minimal with not much bloat. The pics are above average in daylight and good conditions. The monochrome mode is quite fun. But overall white balance is still a hit or miss. And the camera software smoothens out some features that make some pics a bit unnatural sometimes.The charging is very very fast. And the battery stays for a whole day under heavy use.No IP68 rating, no hand gestured photo taking capability like Samsung. But overall, for the price, a top value pick and this is from a Samsung fanboy.

  Design - 4.5Performance- 5UI - 5Camera -4Charging -5 (best in the industry)The phone is super smooth with 120hz refresh rate. I hardly charge it for 20 minutes in a day. The color is super sexy. The phone comes with back cover and screen guard. The oxygen OS is very light skin on stock android. It doesn't come with hd wallpapers. The facelock is super fast. The macro camera is great but over all camera does not compete with Samsung or pixel 5 and iPhone 11.

  It's an amazingly fast device which uses the ultra fast refreshing rate 120hz,I have switched from OnePlus 6T to 8T and quality and experience improvement can be judged very easily. The touch response time is very fast, and at outdoor condition you will face no issues as its having brightness of 1100nits, The speakers are also very loud and clear and the haptic feedback is also very good, like while you're gaming you can feel every vibrations pretty well and battery life in general is solid and it's also have warp charge 65 technology so no issue with battery life and last but not least the cameras also having decent performance but it can further more improved by software updates specially in low light conditions. So just go for it.

  This phone definitely a flagship and beast in performance that's for sure . Performance is top notch no complaints at all. Battery life is ok but could hve been better as it's having 4500 mah, but on the other hand 65 watss charger steals everything thing and am happy they charge insanely fast.Camera <U+0001F4F8> : both cameras are good captures excellent pics.How can I forget the speakers , too loud and awesome display. In a nutshell.. close ur eyes and go for it.One plus good job <U+0001F44D>

  Amazing phone,but camera is sub-standard. Transfer the pictures to laptop and view actual size, you feel like you clicked with a 3yr old 5MP camera.Or just zoom it on your phone screen you will notice it..Battery drains fast.Everything else is great.

  To be honest OnePlus 8T is a awesome mobile with latest Oxygen OS based on Android 11 Operating system. However, couple of cons which i have noticed is; 1) Battery: Need to charge twice a day- all credit to Warp Charge 65 power adapter which is really a boon while you need to charge twice a day.2) I am not sure if anyone has noticed, Mobile Bank applications like Canara bank and Yono (SBI) applications won't open. (Checked with other OnePlus 8T mate and same is the case)3) Camera is other drawback which i hardly use, so people who are not camera freak can ignore.Apart from the above everything is super cool, people can go for it & stay relaxed on the latest updates until next 5 years with 5G mobile.Thanks to Amazon for in time delivery.

  I am using phone 3 days.I like the display it is awesome.I feel some improvement in Network quality also as compare to previous phone(MI A1).Oxygen OS 11 is really cool with some new feature.Phone take 45 min from 0 to 100% to Charge.Camera performs  very good in outside lighting condition , but just ok in Indoor light.Night mode rear cam performance is really nice.I would recommend the ONEPLUS 8T phone if you don't have any Oneplus  7t or 8.I got it in 40K (43-3k discount) in Sale.

  Review after 24 hrsPro -Best phone.Runs anything you give too smooooothly. Tried COD , Asphalt 9. <U+0001F525>Oxygen OS 11 and whole interface is easy and fast.Best display with Amoled & 120Hz refresh rate while surfing or gaming. No display issue as observed on 8 & 8 Pro.Good battery backup,could last one day for moderate usage.Charging speed 0-100 in 39-45mins.Aquamarine green do looks more amazing in actual. Phone looks good & premium.Cons -One star less for Camera quality. For this price we expect a better camera.IP rating and Wireless charging was too expected at this price range.Noticed a little bit heat at start while loading all apps and setting. But later no heat was observed while using, gaming or charging.Don't think much just buy it if you have it in your mind.Hope it was helpful.Thanks for listening.

  Pros:- 120Hz Supersmooth display- Flat display is a welcoming change- Lunar Silver looks very elegant and professional- Performance is very great- Camera is good- Battery charging speed is insaneCons:- Purplish tinting when set on minimum brightness only appears while scrolling- Camera could be better they are using same old sensors which they have used on past generation of one plus devices- 10X zoom is bad. Seems like oil painting at that range- Phone gets hot while charging usually.- Battery backup could be better but charging speed compensate for that

  Meets all expectations! Nothing to complaint about it rather than I will say expandable storage..but still 256gb storage is more than enough.Performance is smooth without any lag or hiccups. Snapdragon 865 is a true multitasker. RAM management is excellent!120hz gives you the feeling as if you are gliding through the screen. Never faced any overheating even while charging with that amazing 65W charger.Camera was not my priority but still it is more than capable of day to day usage. Works satisfactorily in low light as well. Would have been better if IMX686 sensor was provided as main sensor.Haptics and sound quality is amazing!Overall I am satisfied with OP..My first OP device and I am enjoying the experience!

  Been using for a couple of days now. I upgraded from a redmi note 5 pro. I see night and day and in performance of the 2 phones.The camera , in the few pictures I took looked really good. The display is an absolute beast. It just looks gorgeous. The 120Hz just makes it even better. Battery seems decent till now. I feel it is absolutely worth my money.

  This is my first one plus device and I was quite skeptical about downgrading from a QHD+ display (LG V30+) to a Full HD+ display just for the performance but the performance is mind-blowing. Everything is just fluid. 120hz refresh rate is clearly felt when you switch between 60hz and 120hz. The dual speaker setup is fantastic, it has little bassy elements that make listening experience great. Camera still needs improvements and wish a s/w update fixes the issues. The warp charge 65 is great too. Took 20 mins to reach 90% from 25%.Snapdragon 865 under the hood is definitely fast enough to run anything you throw at it coupled with 12 gigs of memory. Overall it's a worthy purchase for the price you pay.

  1) Got this device delivered yesterday and it started heating up during the setup stage only. I ignored it for a while. After charging, thought of transferring my data from my old device to this and with just with just contacs, messages and approx 20 songs the device started heating up again.2) Next, having a warp charger doesn't make sense if the battery is drains at a pretty good speed.3) I have my Airtel sim in the 2nd slot but I cannot use 4g data in that and it is always on 2g network only, God knows why? And OnePlus is marking it as a 5G flagship.About to return the product.Really disappointed.

Most of the images from other cam is not natural it destroys the sharpness.All the plus gets destroyed just for the worse camera. Totally disappointed with the cam performance

  I would not review the specs and other details which are easily available in other reviews, would just like to share my experience.This is a flagship phone! Truly premium and rich. For someone who requires a great processor and a great camera, this serves the purpose. I am an amateur photographer and I was very happy with the reproduction of natural scene by sensors like these! The ultrafast charge and a battery that stays more than a day with mid heavy usage, is the need of the hour. I can manage my tasks at office and home with still more juice left. Gamers, with a refresh rate like 120Hz, I need not say more. To summarise, go ahead if you have the budget and the need. Definitely a great product!

  The OnePlus 8T is a worthy upgrade over its predecessor from six months ago with a better display, faster charging and a new design. While it does add an extra camera to the mix, photography is once again the weakest point of an otherwise great phone.Display: 6.55-inch AMOLED, 120HzDimensions: 160.7mm x 74.1mm x 8.4mmWeight: 186 gramsProcessor: Snapdragon 865 with 5GRAM: 8GB/12GB LPDDR4XStorage: 128 GB/256 GB UFS 3.1Camera: 48MP + 16MP + 5MP + 2MPFront camera: 16MPBattery: 4,500mAh (non-removable)Charging: 65W Warp Charge

  If you're looking for flagship level performance and dont want to spend 50k+ then this is the phone for you if u got 43-46k(u may get for less after disc) also charging is very fast and battery lasts a day on normal usage.Flat display is preferred by many although the curved one looks better but flat will last you better so do consider that .. curved displays are expensive to repair as well compared to the flats.Only setback is the camera which is great too but not the best in this segment but anyway there's no phone in this range which will give u evrything best.. hence u should consider that if u just want the cam, I prefer performance and features so i chose it

  This is my first One Plus smartphone, Ordered on the same day of release and got the delivery superfast by Amazon....Firstly I have misunderstood the word Dual LED which are placed on Rear Camera Panel. I have start torch only one LED was working so I have filed replacement for the same, then I got the advice and clearification form my friend who is techy guy and expert in smartphone. That LED which is placed on top is flicker senser not LED. So I have cancelled the return and finally kept the phone with me....It was very good support from Amazon as well.Thank You and Finally One Plus 8T is Ossam...Recommended to buy without hesitation..

Seems to be storage or software issue.3) Battery gets drain very fast even though with normal uses. Yesterday I hardly able to get backup of 10 hrsBattery is the main concern to worry however I will be checking this for one more day and then decide to keep it or return

  Thank you Amazon for the fast delivery, got this beast the next day. This is my first Oneplus Phone. At first I was confused between MI10T pro and Oneplus 8T. Finally made up my mind and went for OP8T. It was one of the best choice ever made. 120Hz refresh rate, Amoled display with brightness of 1100 nits!! SD865 processor with 5g, quad cameras, 65W fast charging which charges 0-100 in approx 40-45 mins. Battery life is good. Doesnt heat much while normal usage or while charging. No lags at all. Super smooth touch.Cons:Average cameras: 48 mp for a flagship phone! Could have been better, but its good. I hope it'll improve after some software updates.

  Overall the phone is damn good, but I see some following issues in the phone like,1. IVR will not work all the time.2. Notifications are not syncing, though I read the message, still the notification will not clear.3. Sometimes if I click on the notification, it will not redirect to the app. I need to open it manually and clear the notification manually again.4. Keypad will jam quite often while switching from text to emoji and vice versa.I would request OnePlus team to focus on these bugs and fix it ASAP.

  It's my first OnePlus phone as I was waiting for the fast charge 65W with OnePlus for a thousand years.I was concerned about Battery draining but to my surprise, IT IS DOING AN AWESOME JOB and doesn't drain that quickly. Even on 120 Hz.Love this screen. OMG!Charges in 41 mins completely.SAR levels checked.Front camera quality needs a slight improvement.Phone feels premium in hand. Haptic feedback is absolutely painless.I am so happy to join OnePlus community finally.Thanks!

  I have been using Redmi Note 4 from past 3 years and moving to Oneplus 8T is such an amazing experience. Everything is best in this phone. Although it's little pricy, its completely worth it for the experience it providesSome of the best features i cant ignore1) Blazing fast fingerprint and face unlock2) 120hz refresh rate gives a very smooth and fast experience3) 4k video recording4) 12GB RAM and 865 Qualcomm Snapdragon so that you never compromise on performance at any cost5) 1080 HD display<U+0001F603>All over above...man, the charging....charges like a flash,<U+0001F605>

  I was using samsung before buying this phone. But when I heard the price, it felt like its offering flagship features for midrange value, so I bought it. Have to say this that its hardware and processor is best in class, but when it comes to UI it fails miserably. The features, ease of use and customisations that One UI provides are just on next level and can't be compared with the low level and totally buggy Oxygen OS. Its almost same like stock android with slight changes which are taken from One UI. Don't buy this if your old phone is Samsung, its just downgrade.

  Decent  phone but not worth  the value i think ...1 battery  is draining  like hell2 display  brightness is not that  much great  as they  have not given the option of  90hrtz which is problematic3 in my device i I don't  know about others  otg is not supporting or showing up4 netflix is not showing  the support  of HDRAlthough the phone is working smoothly  but these are the problem i am facing  may be they ll get fixed or not bother you but for now i don't  like it.... and i think  everyone who is spending almost 50k should  know these things ....in the end you don't  even have headphone jack also after spending this much money

  I upgraded from oneplus 3t. The difference is huge.Display and audio quality are really amazing.I did not feel that the charging is fast enough as my oneplus 3t also charges at similar speed.Macro camera is not up to the mark, but then why would they give everything which oneplus 8pro has, at a lesser price.Ultr wide and Nightscae photos are good. I added a few samples as well.

Outdated camera sensor.if you are looking for better camera go for s20 fe available at same price after flat 4000 discount from hdfc. Also you get samsung creadit of 4000 to buy accessories from samsung.

After about a week's usage I can say the biggest pros are awesome screen, amazingly fast charging and smoothness of the operation. Build quality is top notch. If you're getting it below 40K post discounts it's a steal.

  I ordered this product on Sat night and received it on Monday noon , being a first time One-Plus user, I now get why people are crazy for this brand, the charging is super duper fast, 18 mins and you are half way through. 120Hz refresh rate is impressive but consumes a lot of power, hence I did switched it to 60Hz (Not bad at all). Camera quality is nice (I am not pro-camera person , so for me it did just the apt thing). Multi-tasking is peanut for this device, no issue with heating. Overall a super bundled package. Thank you Amazon & One-Plus :)

  It is a great phone with amazing performance. Battery life is good and charging is superfast. Display is also amazing with that 120Hz refersh rate. I did not see any display issue like black crush or any color tint. Camera is not that good though, that is the only weak link. Giving one star less only for poor camera.

  Highly recommended for people who want to have a superfast phone. It is best for gaming and has flat screen so u can easily get a compatible tempered glass and cases. Battery backup is good with 120hz turned on it gave me always around 6.5 hrs of screen on time can be even high if 60 hz is turned on. Full charge in 39 mins.

  The best daily driver you can get under 50K.Benefits over the competition:1.Fast Charging 65W (under 40mins 100percent)2. 120Hz refresh rate3.Great performance4. Close to stock Android feel.5. If bought with offers effective price is pretty good.Cons:1.Camera could have been better.2.Wireless Charging missing (if you care about this).3. No curved screen (depends on personal preference).

SD 865 processor it's very fast.Perfomance wise it's very good.2. 120hz display is very smooth3. Quick charge with in 40 minutes it's charge fully.Cons:Need to improve camera quality. I think that in coming updates one plus definitely give a update on this

  Firstly compared to 7t its not at all an upgrade.Camera is average, sensors given are given in 15-20k phones.battery compared to other phones not up to the mark as given..4500mah.Brightness issues it takes time to react while you increase or decrease brightness..It also gets a bit heated...<U+0001F631>. yes heat..not at all expected from one plus..During charge it gets heated while charging, while data tranafer, wifi amd hotspot users will surely experience heating issue..Not at all advisable to buy in 43k..

  I'm writing this review after I used it for 3 days. Phone performance is awesome. Super Fast. I haven't find any issues. It just took 34 minutes to charge from 15% to 100%. Camera, display, call clarity everything is good. May get bothered when you're playing some music with full volume bcoz you will get little vibration/disturbance from phn bcoz of high volume. Android 11 UI is fantastic, very easy to navigate to other apps r options & also some new features in Android 11. Overall, it's worth the money.

  After using a week . Either Use or standby battery will drains fast . Performance good, it's compact and weight is well balanced . Camera is good not excellent.It's not a premium phone .looks they released to cover 40k segement and compromised.Few reviews says colour issue over screen and heating issues. I don't have any. Probably they recieved faulty . As there is sale ,there will huge number sale happened . In them there is few people would have recieved faulty and reviewed here .

  You cannot go wrong with this buy. True flagship. If you are upgrading from existing one plus model you will not notice the difference as OS is the same, but as use the phone you experience the superiority of your device: higher refresh rate, really quick charging, speed ,premium looks and so many other features that amplify the happiness of buying a one plus product.

  Absolutely worth the price. Very light in weight with a flat screen and a perfect grip. Ulta smooth scrolling and amazing camera quality. The 48mp camera gives really crisp and clear images. Video quality is also excellent and meets all expectations. The best part of the device is the warp charge 65. Less than 40mins the device is fully charged. What more specifications can one demand from a phone? Already in love with the product. #neversettle #oneplus8t <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F4AF>

  Awesome phone. Pros everyone are aware of. I will talk about the Cons.1. Phone heating up quite a lot. Almost every task you perform will heat up the phone.2. Camera is not up to that level. Went for OnePlus 8t instead of MI 10t for overall package but camera seems a big let down as compared to its competitor.Other than these 2 major Cons the phone is excellent in performance and call quality.Gaming in it is amazing and exciting.

  Given the price point and offers, the phone is a beast is the least, I could say.120 hz refresh, bigger battery, the overall UI experience, everything is good. Specially the box came with every small things that you may need to start the device.Just that the camera needs some upgrade.Photos added are simple with no HDR or edits.Got same day delivery in Hooghly, Kolkata..<U+0001F60D><U+0001F970>

  Had ben using 5T for 3 years and then upgraded to this. 65W charging and 120Hz refresh rate are the only proper upgrades that I'm very happy about. The camera is good but not great. Battery gives me about 4.5 - 5 hours of screen time and should easily last for a day. Yet another smooth device from OnePlus that's as fast as it gets. It's time OnePlus adds water resistance.

  For review and working of the phone, please go to Youtube, you will get much better reviews of the product. I upgraded from Samsung to Oneplus and every penny is worth. If you are a Oneplus 8 user, no need to upgrade but if not and you are looking for a flagship with a 50K budget then you must go for this phone without giving a second thought. Though I did my own research, you can also decide after viewing unboxing and reviews on Youtube. :-)

  Not happy with the way they are handling  replacement of 8t. My one plus 8t was delivered on October 18.My camera was not working, so I complained for replacement on the same day of delivery. The technician came on October 21 (after three days of delivery) and lodged for replacement.Now they are giving me replacement by November 1. This is not done as new phone is arrived within two days of order while replacement takes 10days. Poor service indeed.

  First and most important is its battery and the charging speed. It takes 40 min to charge full. Secondly I love Lunur silver colour coz it's very decent and looks premium in hand. I'm not a camera person but still it takes high quality photos and for normal usage, it's more than the expectations. It's my first OnePlus mobile shifted from Samsung and it tooks me to next level in mobile experience.  Must buy product if you considering more than 40k mobile.

  The display of the 8T is really good with the 120hz refresh rate. The phone heats up quite frequently. The camera performance is very mediocre. It can be hardly considered to belong in the cost segment it's priced at. The photographs are excessively smoothened out and lacks detail. The saturation and colour is also compromised. This is a big letdown. The macro and the super macro modes are also pretty bad. The cellular network range is not good too.

The price worth product.The only drawbavk with the item that you will not get headset.  So if you have Bluetooth headset then there is not a problem.  For avoiding  charging  of Bluetooth  headset frequenty I have bought Type c to 3.5 mm  audio  jack from amazon only.Awesome  product and I am enjoying  it alot :)

  Smartphone battery is good, but it's charging speed make it awesome. Processor, ram, storage, os are best. For gaming it's the best option. But the only area where it gets very little behind is camera, only a little improvement is needed, you are giving 48mp, while others are giving 64, 108 etc, but the real problem  atleast make your 48 mp better with software improvements. It started showing disturbance at full 48 mp zoom.

  Battery is draining like a 2-3 years old phone. Battery backup is very poor and battery is lasting only for 6-7 hours even for the moderate usage. Expected more from 4500mah battery, but it's totally disappointment. My old oneplus 3t mobile battery will last more than this brand new onleplus 8t. Playing high-end games will drain the battery from 100 to 0 in 3-4 hours.OnePlus team please do the needful..!!!!!!!

  Shift from OnePlus 5T to 8T#It's fluid in performance#Like the digital well being, screen unclock count.# Battery was okay, felt older versions was better. (This might be because of refresh rate)Expected more customisation and better camera.Overall a better phone for users below 7 series.

  In love with the Aquamarine Green colour of my phone... Awesome display with vibrant colours... Satisfied with the camera quality... 120 hz refresh feels buttery smooth...  Charging speed is awesome... If your budget is 40k and your old phone isn't working then close your eyes and buy this phone...

  Overall A Nice Phone except one thing which can bother to selfie lovers is that the front camera being placed at the top left corner of the phone which makes taking selfies difficult as a person has to adjust the position for a straight selfie.Otherwise obviously One Plus Phones never diappoint users while considering other factors.Just In case the selfie camera doesnt bother you then go for it for sure.

  Everything about the phone is just perfect except the fact that I am experiencing battery drainage at a larger level.I slept with 96% and woke up to 92%.And with the delivery,the delivery boy misbehaved with me asking me to collect it from him rather than delivering it to me.He even told that he would return the package if it's not collected within an hour.He was an Amazon delivery agent indeed.

  Amazing product from OnePlus. The image quality is amazing and the phone gets charged in less than half an hour. Even with high usage throughout the day,the battery lasts for an entire day. I was confused whether I should go for a OnePlus phone or an iPhone but after using this for around 3 days now, I can say that it is worth it.

  Awesome Phone..! 120hertz Smooth as all time... 12gb in this price range is awesome deal.. Charging is really speed 100 % in 40 mins. Regarding Camera you may be disappoint, but may be in future with software updates it can be solved.Overall good performance, but while playing high graphic game with UltraHD settings might feel resolution getting distorted sometime, maybe it could be due to network issue.

  Looks good. Battery drainage is there. But as os11 just arrived we have to wait to get stabilised. Yes 60hz makes it more longer than 120hz. They could he have given 90hz option which is absent. Touch, sound, feel, videos, gaming all looks perfect as expected.Water proof or water resistance could have been given. We should be careful with Mike and speaker as they are not water resistance.

OnePlus has made a fool out of people. This phone is not that great as that of other OnePlus phones. 7 series was better than this. From the first day double tap(quick gestures) for screen lock is not working.

By the way attached images are taken by samsung Galaxy S8 which is 3.5 years old and still captures much better images than this device. Don't go for this device if you like clicking pictures a lot.

  Worst possible camera they could give in such a expensive phone. Look at the photos i have added, pictures are grainy and every pixel is about to explode. Also it requires to hold the camera for atleast 5 seconds after the shot to capture a stable image. 3 stars for fast charging and super fast processor. But camera is waste.

  Review after using 8 days (12GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered Lunar silver but received Aquamarine green. I dont' want to spent more time on it, so kept it and it looks good too.Pros:=> Great performance/speed=> Good battery life=> It is priced good considering highend features the phone provides=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Experienced high heating when using the InShare app for sharing media.  This may be because of this app.=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this.As others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, but noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingCamera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. Overall it's a Beast! Highly recommending.

  This is my first OnePlus mobile so I can't compare with other OnePlus mobiles.Pros:120hz display for smoother display and touch experienceFast charging : 0 - 100 % within an hour in optimzed charging mode (else it'll charge in 40 mins, I didn't try it). Battery backup is also very good.No curved display : Personally I like flat displays as curved one is more prone to get cracks and damage easilyCase and Screen protector : you will get case in the box and Screen protector already applied to mobile which are of very decent quality.Oxygen 11: comes with Android 11 based Oxygen 11 OS and features are very cool.Performance : I have been using it from last 4 days but didn't notice any lags. But I am not a gamer so Can't say how it performs while gaming.Misc: Watched a water durability test video which claims it's water resistant but there is no official IP rating on it. Front and back side of the mobile are protected by Corning gorilla glass 5.Rest all specs like 5g, 865 Snapdragon, RAM, Storage, Camera setup,Full aluminium body etc are similar to OnePlus 8.During sale got the mobile with 1 year screen protection plan from ACKO without any extra cost.Cons:Front camera : I felt selfie camera quality could have improved. Looks like software issue, hope OnePlus will fix it in their future updates.Wide angle camera : Needs some improvement.Monochrome camera : I don't think so it's useful, anyone can apply filter and convert the picture to B/W. For the sake of quad camera it's just present.I don't see any other cons, I hope the software issues for cameras that I mentioned in the cons section will get fixed in future s/w updates. Really it's a great mobile.Edit- after used for a weekBack camera is struggling a lot in artificial light conditions.

  Please dont buy 8T. OnePlus is making everyone fools. Never Expected these sort of things. Complete flavour of OnePlus is missing in OnePlus 8T, Completely disappointed and Regret to chose Oneplus 8T. 48mp camera is a clear bogus always camera by default using 12mp camera only. 48mp camera is not at all perfect. OnePlus Messaging App, OnePlus Dialer,Call recording feature, Vehicle parking, Cards, OnePlus Gestures...... many more default OnePlus apps are missing ... All apps are replaced with Google's  stuff in 8T. UI became uncomfortable with these Apps. missing real oneplus feeling.Battery is very disappointing Not even giving 4 hours backup also. waste of money

  This is second mobile i have bought in first sale itself (first being moto g5 plus on flipkart)Here are the pros :1.120 Hz Fluid AMOLED Display2. 5G Snapdragon 8653. Oxygen OS 114. Android 11 (out of the box)5.65 W “Warp charge” (the charging is whooping fast, charger in the box)6. Type-C to Type-C Cable7. no curved screen (mayb a few like it but i don't)8. As we all know 3 years of guaranteed updates.Loaded with these features the mobile comes at 43k . With HDFC discount and exchange offer it can go down further.I think this is best mobile u can buy in this price range.

  Camera is  the major weak point of this phone,just like it was for OnePlus 8.It seems as if OnePlus are now taking their customers for granted.Their thought.process seems to be that most customers are happy with a camera that is just above average and they shove these useless macro and depth sensors down our throats instead of a solid telephoto lens like the one on 7t.I purchased this 8t only bcos it had a flat screen and that I would anyways be using a Google camera port for the camera,because the phone excels in every other area except camera.So if camera is your top priority you would be better served with phones like galaxy s20 fe .If you are one of those tech enthusiasts who is any way going to use a gcam mod , then you can very well go for this phone and you wouldn't be dissapointed.My main issue with the camera is the Inconsistent white balance. The primary camera is capable of taking some great shots when it gets it right. OnePlus needs to up their camera image processing game.Another main issue while clicking pics is the extremely variation in white balance between regular and 2x portrait shots.For 2x portrait shots the white balance is totally off.

  Product is good except camera. Oxygen Os is not upto the mark this time. Seems they haven't done proper testing on android 11.After spending 45k u will get a normal camera which was there in 7t and buggy OS.Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.Hope they come out with updates to solve the problems.I would rate 3 star for this device atleast for now.

Here is my review after using for more than a weekPros:Excellent and smooth 120Hz displayGaming experience is niceCons:1) Battery backup is horrible possible reasons could be phone signal keeps on varying whereas my earlier phone OnePlus5T has stable signal strength. Even otherwise battery backup is horribly wrong2) Adjusting screen brightness takes 1-2s delay to take affect3) Camera quality is not upto the mark in indoors4) while trying to make the phone 5G ready, I feel they have messed up 4G connectivity/signal things big-time.5) Alarms sometimes doesn't work properly.

  Pro -- One of the Best Display with brightness upto 1100 nits . ( Fluid Amoled the same display Samsung uses in its S20 Ultra, it's far better than Super Amoled display)- Oxygen Os Smoothness and Speed.- Fast Charging.- Great Selfie Camera.- Vapour Chamber for Cooling.- One of the Fastest Chipset.- 120hz butter smooth Display.- Stereo Speakers.Con -- Old Camera Sensor = Though I seriously like the Camera, I got the first Update and there was a lot of improvement in overall picture quality, ofcourse If You will Compare it with IPhone definitely You will find some thing missing. Overall the Cameras are awesome, it satisfied My needs.### For those Who are comparing it with Samsung S20 FE, Google Pixel 4a and Mi10T Pro ###> Samsung S20 FE - It has Exynos(4G), which is Trash and there's no way it can compete it with the SD865 (5G).> Google Pixel 4a - Poor battery life, heating issues, Plastic body, Small Screen, Cameras are good but You can't Zoom in due to Low Pixels, hangs or heats up too much while doing heavy task or while gaming or while using multiple social media apps.> Mi10T Pro - Bad display ( only IPS LCD no AMOLED), MIUI contains too much Advertisements ( everytime You install or open or even use the Phone an advertisement will pop-up from nowhere), Poor Cooling management for 144hz gaming.==== At this Price Point You wont get a better Phone with SD865, Fast Charging, Great display, Oxygen OS smoothness and a lot more  ===

  Charging speed is good, battery backup and camera is average, issue in dynamic range, no night mode in front camera,needs to improve in camera, software issue also there, gallery recalculats every time all photos of the albums, and takes some time to create photos after taking shotsBlue tint when taking photos at low battery, gallery loading (recalculating), heating up, camera is average, does not get a feeling of using a premium phone paying on higher side

  No doubt, it's an upgrade over oneplus 8. So many features are added like 65W charger,120Hz refresh rate etc. But believe me, the quality of camera is worst. Oneplus 7 has better camera than this phone. I have been using oneplus 7 since 2 year.  Recieved this product with bubble on screen. If we remove the screen guard, then it costs around 1k for new one. Amazon supports just refused to replace this product and adviced me to visit nearest oneplus store.

  VERDICTDisplay - 9/10Performance - 10/10Battery - 10/10Charging - 10/10Sound & Haptics - 9/10Camera - 8/10Software - 10/10Overall - 9.5/10GO FOR THE 12GB variant. For just an extra 3k, you get 4 GB additional RAM & 128 GB additional storage. They have priced the top variant extremely well and offers excellent value over the base variant.This is my review after 8 days of use ( I bought mine on the very 1st day of sale - 16th):I am a long time user of OnePlus devices, so I knew what to expect. Oxygen OS is the best version of Android even today. However, is unfortunate that OnePlus has started bundling a few unwanted stuff in their software.Those are as follows:1. Login with OnePlus account/  Red Cable Club (RCC) - This is present in the Indian devices and cannot be removed. I don't know why they want to force it upon us.2. OnePlus Cloud - A cloud service which may be useful for some, but forcing it on everyone is unacceptable. A big 'Sign in to Cloud' box shows on your face in the Gallery app and cannot be removed. Very annoying.3. Zen Mode - deeply integrated with the system. This is in addition to the default Digital Wellbeing app.4. Preinstalled apps like Netflix (cannot be uninstalled), OnePlus Buds, Amazon, and a handful of others. These can, however be uninstalled.5. CAMERAS - This is the only disappointment from hardware point of view. Instead of giving the macro and monochrome lenses, they should have given a telephoto lens. That would have been much more useful. I am fine without IP68 & wireless charging.6. in-display Fingerprint scanner is a bit glitchy. Often fails to register/ read fingerprint properly. I think this is a software issue and can be fixed with an update.Pros1. No Facebook services pre-installed. After backlash in the community for installing that in the Nord devices, they acted wisely by removing it and not including it in the 8T.2. Display is great with 120Hz AMOLED. I don't have the black crush/ green tint issue.3. Charging - The most unique part of this phone. Super fast charging. I usually put it on charge when the battery is around 20% and it fully charges under 40 minutes.4. Battery life is great. I have consistently got over 6 hours of screen-on-time everyday. I charge around 20%, so if I push it, I know I can get about 8 hours SOT. But it is NOT advisable to let the battery charge drop below 15%.5. OOS is fluid and super fast. RAM management is great too. With 12GB RAM, I don't have to worry about it. There are a few minor software bugs, and I hope the company would fix them soon. Nothing that would make for a poor user experience though.6. I don't have any heating issues. The phone gets warm to the touch when doing video calls, and that is normal.7. Gaming is great and no lags or any issues. I must say I haven't played too much except for testing purposes.8. Speakers are great with nice haptic feedback. Dolby Atmos is included, but I didn't find any improvement with it. Hopefully they will allow that to be tweaked more in future updates.9. Call quality and network reception/ connectivity are all great.10. Face unlock is superfast.If you are into photography and need best cameras on your phone, this is NOT for you. Even the Samsung Galaxy S20FE has better cameras at a similar price point. Other than that, this is the best phone under 50k if you are okay with no wireless charging/ IP68.Please note that I am NOT saying that the camera is bad. Just that it is not the best, and I wish they had included a telephoto lens. You can take very good pictures and Nightscape is amazing.

  Pros:-OnePlus tag-120hz display is Buttery smooth!-Camera, I will be honest... it's a very good camera but could have been better.. I'm sure through updates it will improve!-battery it's super fast thanks to 65w charger !-The haptic's  in this device is well balanced and it is well pronounced!-Design and in hand feel is just amazing.Cons:-Camera (it's a con for those who want the bestest camera out there...and this is simply not the best)-No IP rating-No wireless charging (which I couldn't care less)

  It is an absolute beast. The aquamarine green looks amazing in the real world. In the box, you'll receive the handset, the famous red cable, and a 65 watt power adapter along with Sim ejector tool, back cover, oneplus stickers and guides.While using the phone in real life, there will be 0 lag, excellent RAM management, and excellent battery life.The charging is blazing fast and that's what we expect from this 65 watt charger.I have charged the phone to 100% on Monday 2 PM and my battery is at 32% on Tuesday 10AM while writing this review. To tell you the truth, I have never experienced this kind of battery backup previously.I have played few games like FIFA and COD and they were smooth as butter.The phone produces excellent color and brightness. Tested the camera on some subjects, and I am very happy with the camera performance so far.Overall, this phone is a beast and it will definitely change your day to day experience. Gamers will definitely like this phone as there are no heating issues while playing and 120hz refresh rate makes everything very smooth.This is an early review and I think it's safe to say that this phone is not going to disappoint.This is the end. Good day everyone. Bye.

  Purchased One Plus 8T on the first day of launch & after using 9 days, quite excited to share my experience. This phone is a masterpiece in terms of spec & performance.I have upgraded from OP6 which I used almost 2 yrs but have no regret of switching to it.It's latest Snapdragon 865 processor with Fluid Amoled, 120Hz refresh rate display is amazing on this phone. All 4 Main Cameras are really awesome & specially that super macro feature is superb. Battery life is agreat it can last to a day after a long usage. Best part is the 65W fast charging which is truly amazing.. I can able to charge completely it in 30-40 mins.. Now I'm a fan of One Plus with this beauty..

  I have purchased this phone with 12gb Ram & 256gb storage, it's also available with 8gb varient. Oneplus T version phone are always good. Oneplus 8 or 8pro has some display and heating issue but this is goodGood part1. Phone charging is very very fast. Charge in 30-40min to 100%2. Decent camera3. It comes with phone cover and temperad glass4. This phone looks like premium quality.5. Snapdragon 865 processor <U+0001F60D>Bad part1. I feel this phone little hot during transferring the phone date from old phone to this one. But it's not all the time. Now it's working well.2. Camera could have been little better. Oneplus need to workon it. Samsung S20 FE has better camera.If someone do not want to buy this phone then I will suggest them.Samsung S20 FE or Mi10T ProThese set are with same range and almost same configuration.I did't not go with Samsung S20FE beacuse it has shitty processor which is octa-core Samsung Exynos 990.

  I m planning to buy iphone 11 but after launching 8t I decided to buy 8t because of display, charging speed, performance, higher internal storage for lower price.Pros1.amazing screen without any issues2. battery, SOT is above 8 hrs3. Performance4. Camera with great photos and great night mode-  I was using gcam and sd865 processing is great for gcam and stock camera photos also.5. Front camera also good6. Oxygen os 117. Charging- 15 to 100% in 32 minutesCons.1. Price is little bit higher. If they priced under 40k then it will be great deal.Verdict:If you want allrounder phone definitely go for it of 256gb variant because if you use this phone long term usage then definitely need high storage.

  Well you must already know the specifications of this device by now and this device is a beast.it took me less than 3 min to download and install around 40 appsi would suggest you go with the 12gb RAM variant120Hz display is butter smooth and you do notice the difference between a 60hz and a 120hz displayI was a little skeptical about the camera performance but if you are not a photographer  this camera is more than enough for youBattery life is pretty goodIt will easily last you for a day but keep in mind that this is not a two days deviceCharging speed is just unreal it charges to 100% in 45 min which is insaneConnectivity A+ no issues thereJust one concern- they should have given the type-c to 3.5mm dongleso just go for itits a great deal

  Received on 18th Oct 2020. 1+2, 1+3,1+5,1+6t n now 1+8t. Oxygen OS is too good and never had any reason to switch to any other brands.Battery back up is good for a day.Considered Mi10t pro but only good thing about that phone may be that 108mp camera.Stuck to 1+ mainly coz of the almost stock android experience.Built quality is good, stereo speakers now sound excellent, volume is adequate.Always on display is a boon.Camera quality is good for daily photography n all. If I need dslr quality photos, I would use a Dslr.Charging is lighting fast with new 65w charger.This is definitely not a flagship model but it was a good phone to upgrade from 6T.Sold off my back up iPhone 6S as exchange for 1+8t <U+0001F606>. If any queries, drop me a message. Will update after further usage.

  This phone is very powerful which is clearly evident from its spec-list.Let me give some pros and cons after around a week of of usePros:* Great display (120 Hz is buttery smooth)*Flagship processor (SD 865). No lag whatsoever* Oxygen OS* Good battery easily lasting for 1.5 days*Fast charging speed is crazy (charging 0 to 100% in 40 mins) and no the phone doesn't get hot while the charger heats up a bit which is expected*I didn't observe any significant heating while playing games*Solid build - Aluminum frame with glass back.*5G (although it will only useful in the future)*Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1* 48 MP Main camera and wide angle camera is very good*Included case is goodCons:*I didn't like the 2MP micro camera and the chromatic camera (should have given a telephoto)

  I have moved from iOS to Android and trust me to have this beast during the transition phase is an absolute pleasure. Display is amazing, 120 hgz refresh rate really does the job in terms of your viewing experience going to the next level. I don't play games but usually keep on checking emails,chats etc as part of work and this is much better than an iPhone where in entire day was spent on charging the phone. Camera is superb as well. To sum up its indeed is a great buy.

  A great phone at this price. The back main camera pictures are nice but they should improve the front camera specially provide night mode. Battery life is good and last throughout the day. It gets a little warm sometimes, note I don't play heavy games much and there is a hollow feeling at the back of the phone when speakers are on. But overall I'm happy with my decision and the performance of the phone is undoubtedly great.

  This is not a ranting review, it's friendly advice that would save you some money and time.I was using Oneplus 6 before upgrading to Oneplus 8T. Of course, wanted to experience that improved performance and high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate that everyone is talking about.But, the problem with Oneplus 8T is the display itself. First of all, if you are getting Oneplus 8T, you gonna have screen issues straight out of the box.Reference keywords for your Google research:- Oneplus Purple Tint- Oneplus Black Crush- Oneplus GhostingMine was Purple Tint.Remember those old phones we used to use 8 years back that had this poorly made screens which looked sharp from the front but when you tilt it to a certain extent all the colours get washed?Same happening here when I keep my phone brightness under 30%.Secondly, the screen brightness is like an old tube light. When you increase or decrease your screen brightness using the toggle in the notification panel, it will take some time to respond to the change.For example: if I increase my brightness from 30% to 70%, it will take a good half-second to respond to that change. Increasing brightness on this device is not instant on this device is all I am saying.Sadly, the phone at this price point can't even keep up with the competition when it comes to the screen quality.Lastly, I would highly recommend reading some Google reviews before buying this product.

  I ordered it within 10 seconds of opening of the sale and received delivery on very next day. No issue in delivery. But it seems expensive and over priced. One plus 8 is more impressive in looks and more sleek. One plus 8t disappointed me in matter of looks, overall performance is ok but it drain bettery very fast  no doubt charger is very fast.Nothing new in it and at this price tag people expect more inovative but this time OnePlus disappointed me because of looks, thickness and body finish of oneus 8t. I am not happy with this purchase.

  This is my first experience with one plus which is not good at all. Initially whhen the phone was delivered i was prtty kuch excited but as I strt to install stuff n set up my google ac n all the phone strtd to heat up. I put it on charge it heated up prtty bad. Okay so does any new phone gts heated up on the 1st day itself? I was very disappointed . I contacted Amazon customers service thy sent a tchnician at my plce , he said the phone doesn't have any issue . I didn't have any other choice left then to use it.I would rate my experience till now- Battery - 3.5/5 ( battry backup is not good at all)Camera- 4.5/5Speed- 4/5Sound -4.5/5Screen qualify -4/5The only issue is that it heats up very fast n vry bad. While playin not so heavy games it heats up. While charging it heats up prtty bad.Overall i would say i expxtd much more at this price from one plus. Its would make an awesome phne if there was no heating issues.

  I have been using the Oneplus 8T for a week now and the experience has been good. A lot of consumers might be confused between buying the 8 and 8T because they are so similarly priced. I will, however, give you my perspective as to why I did not go with the 8 or 8 Pro. To start with, both have curved displays, which as you may know are fragile. Though I won't call myself a rough user, I have dropped my phones a few times.  Accidents happen!According to Oneplus India's official site, the following are the prices for replacing a damaged screen on 8 series phones:8 - <U+20B9>13,5008T - <U+20B9>13,7008 Pro - <U+20B9>16,300The 8T comes with a 120Hz screen, compared to the 90Hz on the 8 and 8 Pro. Can you notice the difference between a 90 and 120Hz display panel? I don't know. I used the Oneplus 3T before this. Compare the 3T with the 8T and the latter feels like a massive upgrade. The 6.55 inches Fluid AMOLED display gives you a very pleasant experience while watching Prime or YouTube videos.  The 120Hz refresh rate makes day to day multitasking a breeze. Since the time I have had this, I haven't even once connected my phone to my Bluetooth speaker because the audio experience is good and loud with the dual stereo speakers. The display has HDR10+ support. The screen is extremely bright even when viewed under direct sunlight. Not to mention the 8 Pro has display issues as reported by a lot of users. I have found no issues with the display in my use with the 8T so far.With the T variants before, Oneplus used to push the limit and go with the 'plus' processor, but they haven't this time, which I felt was slightly disappointing. I have seen speed tests between the 8T and Asus ROG 3, which comes with the SD865+. There were minor differences between themSince the phone ships with latest Android 11 and Oxygen OS 11, I felt the software experience could have been better and more tuned since there were a lot of bugs in the UI, which I hope will be fixed. Oneplus has been known to provide great software support to all their devices, so you know you are covered on that side.I used the Oneplus 3T for almost 4 years before this and I do agree that Oneplus  cameras aren't really close to the ones on the Samsung, Apple and Pixel devices. The AI or computational photography features like nightscape/night-mode on today's smartphones are decent at best. If you have handled a DSLR like me and know the basics of photography, you can click some really good pictures with this device. The macro and monochrome cameras weren't really necessary, Oneplus should have gone with the Telephoto lens instead.Even with the 65W charging the phone doesn't heat as much as my 3T, thanks to its vapor chamber cooling system. I wish, Oneplus would have provided us with features like Scheduled, Slow and by-pass charging to increase the longevity of a our batteries.Pro-Tip: If you want to make your phone even more snappier, turn off the animations by enabling the developer mode in the settings. Also, the Lunar Silver variant looks sexy.  Take a look at the pictures.

  This review is from a normal user, a working personal. Best useful feature for me is fast charging. Amoled display is noticeably better than IPS LCD. Camera is surely better than most phones under 30k. Phone is very fast. And phone speakers are very loud and clear. Audio quality is also superb. Most importantly if you're just a normal user who mainly use phone for calls, checking social media, occasionally clicking snaps then I don't suggest to buy expensive phone. 20k phones are enough for that kind of usage. High spec phones are for hard-core users and gamers.

  This is my first one plus device and I mus say I am impressed. I have received this device on 18th oct and have been using this for past 7 days. Here are my two cents-Pros-1. Buttery smooth performance. 120hz is a treat2.Fluid amoled display- great colors and contrast3. Camera is pretty good in day light conditions and there are ample settings available including pro mode (f1.7 aperture)4.Charging speed is phoenamenal. Love the warp charge 65Cons:1. While setting up the device, phone did get quite heated and os gave warning. It basically happened during app transfer from my old device. Although after that even during charging I never saw temperature going above 40. With normal to heavy usage it remains under 40 degrees which is good.2. Low light camera performance is noisy.although with nightscape one can take decent photos.3. Few apps such as Kotak Mahindra are not working on android 11/oxygen 11With that being said I didn't notice anything else- no black crush,green tint or purple tint/banding. All good. In this price segment, it is well justified phone.

   A great handset from OnePlus again!Pros:Warp Charging - 0-100 in 35-40minFlat DisplayPerformance with SD 865Very good sound qualityVideo stabilization is awesome!Cons:Playstore is having some issues while downloading some specific apps. Those apps are not getting installed. Many users have reported it. They will fix it next update mostly.Battery backup is average. 5-6 hours SOT in 120Hz refresh rate.Camera is just above average. Night mode is good.

  The aquamarine green looks better than images. The display is butter smooth, I also have a Poco x2 which has 120hz smoothness is better than poco in this phone. Sd 865 handles each and every task easily no stutters at all even on pubg with hdr extreme.Haptic motor is also very good just like OnePlus 8 pro.Camera is great but not the best in this price range.Phone doesn't heat up while charging at 65w btw it fully charges in 38-39 minutes.Stereo speaker is also very good. Display is color accurate. Overall it is killer in this price... And feels premiumAnd the back is not fingerprint magnet its quite nice...  I would prefer you to buy aquamarine green.

  One plus just loosing it's image. This is my first one plus phone and I got disappointed from this. Lots of software issues I am facing from this phone.Camera quality is just like a 20k phone. Battery is very much poor , do not last for atleast a single day. It must be around 5500 mah with this drainage of battery. I am unable to update one plus gallery, everytime is shows software error.Can't use stock android experience. Where the hell is oxygen OS, its very poor. My older vivo nex was far better in terms of software and UI.Call recording function not available, I can't understand simply 10k phones now a days have it.IMX 586 is outdated still they are using it in T version. One plus Nord and this device got almost same primary camera. My 2nd SIM is running on 4G or not, it is not showing. The same DDR4 , atleast this can be improved. What is meaning of T version.Camera 6/10.Battery 5/10Display 8/10Performance 9/10Software and UI 4/10Charging 10/10

  Right of the bat, I would like to list the slightly bad thing about the phone which is pretty much the camera. It does the job though. It's a pretty decent camera which will practically do anything you might want to do in your day to day use. If you just want to professionally shoot pictures, just buy a camera.Now that the camera is out of the way, I think there is nothing where OnePlus is lacking. The display is absolutely gorgeous (and it's FLAT). The bezels are thin and sweet. The performance is absolutely crushing any other phone in this range (at par with the flagships). The feel of the phone in the hand and looks are just great. The 120Hz feels very smooth. And finally, the Oxygen OS is gorgeous.I would say if you are looking for a phone which has the best camera, this is not it. But if you are okay with a decent camera, this phone is an absolute beast everywhere else.

  Pros; Performance & Battery life is very impressive.Cons; Very Low standard Camera in this price point specially the Selfie camera,in low light conditions its like low range oppo vivo selifie. As u can see in my uploaded images, Unnatural  tones and added colours,where as the rear camera is a bit acceptable.as a whole in this price point ans segment Cameras Could have been improved.Even older 6T camera selfie is far better than 8T

Also, apart from main and wide angle, other 2 sensors are just to add numberCamera (Front) - Gets the job done againUI - New oxygen OS update is welcome changeWifi reception - No issuesHeating - Slight but well under control, nothing to worry about.Cellular reception and call quality - Top notch (specially impressed here)

  Satisfied with the Phone Build Quality, Charging Speed, Display, Battery Backup and you name it. Camera quality is good and I have seen some videos comparing it with Samsung S20FE and iPhone 11. Those mobile costs 6k more than OnePlus 8T and camera quality difference is negligible. Of course FT and 11 does better job in some condition but in some OnePlus 8T is best. Instead of Macro and Monochrome in 8T they could have went with Telephoto lens but hey you cant have all right configuration in a smartphone and if it does people wont buy OnePlus 8 or OnePlus 8Pro. The main camera sensor used in OnePlus8T is same as OnePlus 7 till OnePlus 8Pro. so that's 2 year old hardware but its best at what it is.  Anyway there is always GCam mod and you can use that to take pics. Worth the Price. Go for it.

  Extra ordinary on one side, terrible on the other.Pros:1. Good display with 120 Hz sceeen. Simply stunning.2. Super fast processor and OS. Though Android 11 has some glitches, I'm sure OP will fix them soon.3. Aesthetically designed well, weight distribution is uniform & handling the phone is way easier thanks to the flat screen.4. Load speaker is good though the bottom speaker is loader making the steteo experience little awkward at times. But never mind, they're good.5. The haptic feedback of the vibration motar is good and feels premium6. Build quality is top notch. The camera bump looks way better in reality than in the picturesCons1. Oh god, what a horrible camera. It's pathetic. I previously used OP6 and felt even that 3 year old phone does a similar job at clicking below par pictures.2. Why make a glass phone if you don't want to include wireless charging. Specially in 2020, at 46k? Its like spending money on an expensive suit and not buy shoes but wear flip flops! HuhConclusion: it's a decent phone but I feel OP got it all wrong with the pricing and features of their 3 phones. The Nord, regular and the pro series. The OP Pro at almost 14k more expensive than the regular isn't worth it for what it offers. But again, is the One plus regular worth over the nord at almost 20k premium? 765G processor is just as good is what I've heard. If you can wait, please don't buy 8T or 8 Pro. Wait for 9.Dear OP, instead of cutting down on \"not so expensive stuff\" on your regular versions, please try to create something new for your Pro versions that would make them worthy of buying.q

  Being used to OnePlus family of devices right from the One to Five to now 8T, it's been a journey of change, bigger screens, fast to ultra fast charging, however the camera could've been better!+120Hz is slick, you may not want to go back to 60Hz+Warp charge 65 is blazing fast, and the bottom doesn't heat up as well+Display is nice and pleasing+Droid 11 out of the box, however Oxygen OS has the biggest change by deviating from stock Android to customisations (some would like it while some wouldn't)+Buttery smooth OS, works like a charm-Some customisations are really good use-battery lasts for a day and more based on usage, but with the warp charge, you never run out of power+Cooling system is too good, you never feel too much heat even after long hours of use or gaming+Always on is a nice feature and I love the Canvas-Camera is good but nothing evolutionary, OP needs to work in this areas on hardware rather than always tweaking the algorithms-Some apps are not customized to 120Hz refresh and may act weird-OS design seems to be heavily influenced from Samsung, OP can do better on their own and do good-Elegant design nevertheless, nothing groundbreaking-Might feel a tad heavy for someLastly,Aquamarine green looks lovely in the hand, worth picking it up over the SilverOp7t users and above can wait for Op9

  I ordered the phone with 7 minutes after the launch @ Amazon - I have received the product by next day- Packaging and delivery was pretty fast and good as usual.Post unboxing - Phone display and performance are really awesome  12GB + 256 GB storage - 120 Hz display gives the complete ultra smooth display.Battery remains for a day and half - 27 hrs with Wifi on.Camera quality - 4.5 / 5Display - 5/5Battery - 4.3/5Finally  the Oneplus 8T is a great flagship from Oneplus - Thanks for the Nice Design!

  Here is the review of my own device.Starting with the screen-1. Beautiful amoled panel with accurate colours.2. 120hz display is lit.3. Brightness goes really high, didn't face any problem while using on direct sunlight.4. Flat screen is more secure than curve.Performance-1. Snapdragon 865, lag free experiences.2. In Day to day use, no problem.Camera -1. Sony imx586 is here, pictures are lil more saturated.2. Nightscape is great.3. Video quality is good enough and stable too.Looks n feel-1. This have glass back so its too slippery. (Use protective case, use soft case)2. The colour aquamarine green is sick. This one is glossy. My friend bought the lunar silver one, that's matte finish.Summary-Great performance, good enough camera and the 65watt charge is also fast it takes max 44-45min to charge 0-100% . *Oneplus give software update fast to upgrade ta camera quality*

  I was very confused between lots of phones be it One Plus 8T or Samsung S20+, Samsung S20 FE or iphone 11 during the sale this diwali.It was really tough to choose but I am happy that I chose OnePlus 8T.Why did I choose OnePlus and why it was better than buying Iphone 11 or Samsung S20+ for me?1. Future reday with 5G : I know 5G will take some time to hit india but I wanted that piece of mind that even if it comes early, I would not be left behind or I wouldn't have to rush to buy a phone.2. Battery and charging : i do a lot of my office work on email , whatsapp or teams and have a very high screen time. I do not have a lot of time during day to charge my phone . Obeplus comes with a charger that charges this mobile in like 45 minutes and the battery backup is also great.3. Processor and heating : I had my doubts on Samsung Exynos so Snapdragon 865 next best to apple bionic. No heating and smooth performance..4. Great display : 120 HZ vs Apple iphone 11 was a big deal for me.i had yo experience this myself and oh boy this is like buttery smooth.5. Design : the build quality is top notch and premium finishCamera output especially night mode shots are great. I can't say better than Samsung or apple as I have not used them but anyways camera was not my first preference while buying phone so that's also ok for me.Overall if you are looking for a great allrounder device, a device for your heavy duty day to day usage please go with OnePlus 8T.

  It is my first OnePlus device. What a brilliant device it is.Pros I found:1) Very good build quality. Feels very premium in hand.2) The screen is super smooth.3) Performance is awesome.4 ) Very good battery life. I'm a normal user and I'm getting around 1 day.The charging speed is just super fast.5) Camera is descent. I don't buy phones expecting a dslr camera quality. A descent camera is ok for me. If u want best camera buy a dedicated camera.6) Oxygen OS is clean and butter smooth. Loved it!7) Alot of customizations.8) I use a type c to 3.5mm adapter to connect my headphones. I must say the sound output is just awesome.Cons:1) The camera department. It's descent. If you are expecting a best camera then it is not. They are giving new updates to improve it.No more cons I can think of.And few more things I must say. I think many got the device as a gift. Because they are complaining for something which was already there.-> The product details clearly says it has no headphone jack. And I see people complaining about headphone jack.-> Most reviewers said camera is descent only.-> The screen is 120hz. So it will drain some battery. Still it's not bad. Can survive a day easily with normal use. And you are getting a 65w warp charger.-> For those who are telling there are better devices than this at this price range, seriously you know this before buying right?Afterall whichever devices you select, it won't match a OnePlus and the feel it gives.

  I bought it on the 1st day of the Great Indian Festival. Posting this review after using it for 1 week.1. Amazing Display: The 120Hz display makes it super smooth.(I was previously using Red Magic 3 which had a 90 Hz display. I can say the difference is visible)2. Good Battery Life: Its 2020, lets agree all phones it this range are coming with big battery. The battery(4500 mah) is decent enough to take you through your day considering the amazing 120 hz refresh is always on. Again the amazing fast charging always keeps you going within 10 mins of charging.3. Camera: I won't say its the best camera out there but its really good. As OnePlus has been using the same camera for the past some versions of Oneplus flagships, shows up that refinement in picture quality.4. Performance: There is no complaints here, the SD 865 paired with 8 GB & that refresh ratio, you can expect everything to be fluid be it watching videos, playing high end games, scrolling etc5. Build Quality is also pretty good.6. Good to have all latest - wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, Ufs 3.1

  Its been a week since am using oneplus 8T. And am facing issue from the very beginning. I had to format my phone 3 times within a week because of the issues in it after being told to do so by the customer care. First my gmail was not working. 2nd time there was problem in the play store where it was crashing again and again. 3rd time there was problem with the network where suddenly my phone stopped receiving incoming call nor i was able to do outgoing calls than i had to restart my phone that it worked and this happened atleast 2 times a day so i has to reset the network settings. Now am not able to download apps from play store which are higher than 200mb. I have attached the screenshot of the error it is showing. Now they are saying to wait for the next update because as per them this is the issue with many users, and till then i cant download apps bigger than 200 mb from playstore.This was my experience with this device . Totally disappointed and I suggest all not to buy this phone at all. Oneplus is no longer a flagship killer.

  Superb in this price segment.Pros:-1) 65W Fast Charging2) Camera setup (top left side)3)  Build QualityCons:-1) Weight is not equally distributed, heavy in down side of device2) Processor need improvement3) 90Hz refresh rate options not available only 60 and 120Hz available4) Display ( OnePlus 8 have batter then 8T )5) Design ( Not feel premium in hand must give in curved display )This review after use 2 day of uses and i am used it very hardly its battery backup is around 7-8 hours of heavy use like YouTube, Call of duty etc. But if you are light user then it will provide you 13-14 hours battery backup. If you want 5G and 65W charger then please go for it you never disappoint or regret for this device.

  Classic Oneplus product as you'd expect from a flagship killer aka non flagship device.1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7t, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.5 Camera: It's good for the price, but when you look at the competition, pixel and S20FE, they have better cameras. Not saying it's bad just it falls behind the competition in this price segment. It's the only weak part of this phone because the rest all things of this phone are soo good that this camera system makes itself visible as a potential weakness in it. Still though it's a good camera.Honorable mentions : Dear ONEPLUS, I've been a fan from the first phone you have launched and I've personally used it which is the one plus one and I've used many other oneplus phones after that and there after many of my family members and friends began to buy considering the value you provide for the amount we are paying. But there are certain things which has to be mandatory if you consider any phone a flagship i.e wireless charging and a proper IP rating.Personally this is a major draw back of the phone considering its competition, the S20FE has both and many people may go for samsung just because of those 2 reasons which adds to the durability of the phone. Hope you hear me out and include those 2 major check points in the coming models.

  Was waiting to upgrade from 3T and since was happy finally upgraded to 8T.Pretty decent and working as expected for 3 days of usage , Wrap charge is big change seriously Full charge in less than 1 hr and good  battery backup. Pretty decent photos and macro mode.Sound is good as you have stereo speakers.The display and refresh speed you can see a considerable improvement.At last you can blindly get this phone.

  Phone is good in all the features, Liked it a lot till now except the Battery Backup is not at all good if you are a continuous user of Mobile for complete whole day, you need to charge it twice/thrice a day..Rest everything is fine, Charging speed is really nice.. But never expected this low level of Battery Backup.. Disappointed <U+0001F615>Some other problems as well encountered after using it for 4 days..Not at all expected from one plus<U+0001F64F>

  I read lot of reviews and all but it's my opinionWhat I like:- It's the fastest charging I've seen (0-100 less than 40 min)- Signal reception(Data speeds), I don't about how Apple, Samsung or any other flagships handle this (but one plus nailed it)(well I'm only talking about 4G, don't know about 5G).- Camera (Lot of people saying there are better options for me it's more than enough, Well I'm not a camera freak)- Display is good(don't know whether it's the best, but if it's in 120Hz mode battery is draining faster Currently I'm using 60Hz mode I'm getting almost a full day(12-18hrs screen time) in 60, but not in 120 it around 6-8 hrs screen time).What I dont like:- Weight- I actually like smaller screens but yeah I can adjust with it.- It's heating (I'm not sure about the measurements but I can feel that heat) when browsing a lot, downloading big files, the hotspot, little gaming(coc), and charging (In the youtube reviews they're saying it's fine but for me I don't feel like it's fine.)

  Technically my fourth one plus phone (I even had the first one plus 1 not in pic). But this time it's been a let down :( .With the high refresh rates I think the phone is not able to handle the low resolution videos. There is a lot of noise in the videos. Tested on insta, YouTube, Facebook. Even tried removing the screen guard with no improvement. Not sure if this can be corrected by software.The screen is big even though narrow and one needs to use both hands playing around.Pros:Charging is fast and camera is good. And high resolution videos good.

  Everything is great about the phone except the heating issue. It became quite hot during initial setup and remains warm on normal usage also all the time at the top railing and around camera.I have installed CPU Z and Cpu monitor appns and saw a constant cpu temp of 42 to 50 °C and battery temperature of upto 40°CHave requested Amazon technician checkup!

  I really liked the device. Here are few of my findings.Pros:1. Battery Backup is better than expected. Last more than a day with normal usage.2. Hdr10+ and 120hz makes the display perfect.3. Network connectivity is better because of 5g support.4. Good looking Design and phone feels good in hand.5. Fast charging is a real time saver. I used op5 and this device charges significantly faster than that.6. Sound quality and loudness is apt. Stereo speakers are good enough for normal media consumption.Cons:1. Prime and Netflix doesn't support full screen and hdr as yet which kind of ruins the experience.2. Cameras could have been better. Although Nightscape mode is good.Overall it's a great device if you like flat display else go for op8.

  Buy only if you have older model of phones. Warp charging is really blazing fast. Sound quality is excellent. Nothing looks practically new with 120hz refresh rate or Oxygen OS11 based on Android 11. I was already using OnePlus 7 and hence don't feel any major update in OnePlus 8T.On the contrary, I am unable to publish anything on OnePlus community as the phone gets hanged while publishing post. Also I can't update OnePlus Gallery app in play Store as all the time it  says there is some problem in update.Features like variety of navigation gestures, sms category byfurcation are much more better in OnePlus 7 than this phone. Hopefully OnePlus restores these features in OTA updates soon..

  Bought Aqua Marine model, This is my first experience with One Plus device, and I have really been disappointed so far, the phone heats up on regular calls, while playing music and other stuffs, the battery drain is very bad. I am getting maximum screen on time of 4hrs.With 4500mAh battery I expected a lot more. This is acting like a 10-15k phone, even those phone do not heat so easily nowadays. Main Camera is Good same as Nord.The display at 120hz is the only plus point, speaker is also good, two cameras are just for show you can cover the two lenses and still take the Macro Photos with the main sensor.I will probably return the phone I am very disappointed. While writing this review the phone has started heating up.Also to mention it's very hectic task to get the phone returned. Bad bad experience with both Amazon and OnePlus 8TI have also shared the battery drain screenshots. Hope it helps to other shoppers.

  This review is about the big blunder done by Oneplus and Amazon.I ordered the 12 gb RAM variant on Oct 17 and received the 8 gb RAM variant on Oct 19. I immediately notified Amazon support and they agreed that wrong item has been sent. I asked them for replacement and they said that product is out of stock, I can add it to wishlist and once I get notified that it's available, I should call them and request for replacement. So, they delegated their job to me.It became available again in the evening of Oct 19, so I called them back and asked them to order the replacement as I wasn't able to do it on my own. I was kept on hold for 15 minutes and then told to disconnect as the team wasn't available.I called them again after some time and then the service executive said that he is unable to, but his leads and managers will create a replacement request in next 1-2 minutes. Those 2 minutes never ended and I was on the call with them for more than an hour which again ended in disappointment as his so called manager was also unable to create the replacement. In the end he told me to return the device and order a new one. I asked him will I get the same offers and discounts to which he blatantly lied saying yes. But when I checked the discounts were already down from <U+20B9>1,750 to <U+20B9>1,500.I also told him that I can't use my HDFC card again and the device quantity is also limited to 1 unit per account, he advised me to either select a different color or borrow card from a friend and use another account. I was really surprised with such a fabulous piece of advice from the best customer centric company in the world.Then I asked him to escalate as he was straight away lying and trying to get rid of me, but to my surprise the next level executive also had next level IQ. She told me if I'm ready to accept the wrong variant she'll go over and beyond to compensate. I asked her what can she do, she said she'll ask her leads and call me back in 15 minutes.She did called after 15 minutes to say that we'll refund <U+20B9>700 to your Amazon pay account if I keep the 128 gb variant. I don't know how she calculated that difference maybe using a Amazon designed cheater calculator. Everyone can see the there is a difference of <U+20B9>3,000 in 256 gb and 128 gb variants, but she said \"no sir, this amount is too huge for us to process\".I again gathered courage and asked her not to converse with me further and again escalate the issue. She said I'll get a call back in 24-48 hours but at the time of writing this review I've not received any calls from Amazon.Yesterday, I got an email saying that a team is working on it and need 4 working days to resolve. After committing the blunder and 3 hours of calls with the customer, they still need time.I did trust Amazon and have never faced any issues in past 5 years I've been associated with them, but this time they have really disappointed me. I accept the fact that mistakes do happen in a large supply chain but even after accepting they are not ready to do anything. The customer support executives are lying, harassing customers by making them wait longer, copy pasting standard email replies where they don't even edit the customer's name, one of the executives addressed me as \"Saleem\". So, yes their customer support is surely going downhill.I do request you all to not blindly trust these support executives for your own good. Be vigilant about the products that you order and receive.

  I've been waiting for this phone's release from one month because I didn't want to buy One Plus 8 because of the curved display and..I was not disappointed...-*Display* is awesome...better than one plus 8 because I've heard that they've improved the brightness levels-*120Hz Refresh rate*....although 90hz is more than enough but in gaming and some other areas 120hz will be usefull...-*4500mah battery* is enough for our daily usage but ...you know 120hz will drain the battery faster when compared with 60hz and 90hz ..but you'll get 5-6 hours screen time easily in 120hz too-*65W charging*...woah full charging in less than 45 min ... I've kept charging at 1:10am at 18% and started surfing Instagram by the time 1:50am it was 99%..lol..-*Cameras*... I've shared some samples.. pls don't judge by those photo's because I've captured those pics 5mim before writing this review only..but they came pretty good..those were just clicked casually..but if you use them properly you'll get better pics..and they've improved the camera software and Ive heard it is better than one plus 8... they've improved ultra wide and macro camera also-*Oxygen OS*..you know Oxygen OS is awesome..I've upgraded from MiUI and I can find so much difference..no ads at all and clean software..no blotware...they have even removed Facebook lol..only Google apps and Amazon were pre installed...You can even buy oneplus phones for Oxygen OS only..it is that good-*Gaming*.. Snapdragon 865 will handle almost every game pretty well.. battery drain is also less while I'm playing Pubg and other games-Phone is very good looking and very comfortable to carry  Finally I'm happy with my purchase and specs wise it is better than OnePlus 8..But it is your wish because some feel curved display are more premium so if you like curved display you can take one plus 8..but if you're ok with any type of screen then you should definitely pick 8T over 8 ....because 8T has better specs in almost every aspect

  I rarely write reviews but this time I thought I need to share my experience, I was little disappointed to see how Indian audience get influenced by tech reviewers (especially the USA one). They are comparing a device which is launched $100 more to an Indian pricing so there experience will be totally different considering the price point.In India it is for almost $540 dollars. In this price range I don't think we will get any better value. Very good phone with an above average camera, if you're clicking for social media then in 95% of the cases all the high-end camera looks same. Software experience is surreal; Almost similar like pixel.Pixel 5  and 4A 5G is not available in India plus Google mobile strategy sucks in IndiaSamsung FE is 130 dollars more than 8T. I was using S9 and believe me after 7-8 months Samsung phones start lagging. They force you to use their crappySamsung play store. Samsung software is really pain some time.iPhone 12 - Damm expensive in an Indian market, Price difference from an International pricing is insane.Apparently Yes, They are doing to much marketing with their camera system. 2 lenses are crap but overall its a very capable Cam plus if we get the GCAM for 8T. BOOM.Under 550$ this is the best value a consumer can get in an Indian market.I am using this device for the last 6 days - No heating issues (I didn't use for gaming purpose), No blue or red tint on screen, Sound quality is good but it's just you feel little vibration at back when u play songs at max volume - I reckon its common in stereo speakers because i felt the same in other devices also.P.S: Not a 1+ fan, never used their devices as my regular daily drivers (previously I was using Galaxy S8/S9 and believe me it feels 3X faster to those phones) but this is the company which is really hearing their customer (especially in India) Cheers!

   1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS 11, which runs as smooth as they come.2) SUPER AMOLED screen and 120Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above best.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is best.7) Phone Charging is mind blowing. Need just 40 min to Full charge.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is Very very fast.10) The camera is good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera is awesome. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording1080@60fps performance is good. (The camera is better than most phones out there)11) No headphone jack.12) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio is well delivered on a stereo speaker.413) No expandable memory slot.14) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen is as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.

  I got it on16th October via one day delivery.So after using 3 days I am writing this review.As far as the display, it is very smooth we can really feel the difference between 60hz screen & 120hz screen. We can easily look at the screen clearly even in the sunlight, thanks to one plus for increasing brightness nits upto 1090. So display is very smooth, you will love it.Also, the latest processor SD865 performs very good. I played COD Mobile. The experience was awesome. Gaming was smooth. It also comes with Game Space that allows us to play games peacefully. While gaming or charging it heats a little but which is negligible as temp. (39-41 deg. Celcius) is very low as compared to other devices.Camera is very good. But there is not latest sensor. If provided it could be great. But difference is noticable only when you zoom image to final level or you are a camera freak.It is almost as good as OP8, I have to say a little better than OP8. But not better than OP8 Pro. But a normal person like me who uses camera occasionally, it does not make any difference.I prefer latest processor and display.It also includes Oxygen OS & Android 11 out of the box which makes it again more interesting due to its awesome features.And this all comes at a price of 42999/- only.I got it for 39000/- at AGIF Sale.So it is a great deal at 42999/-.

  Ordered a week back. No complaints till now. Battery backup and optimization is awesome and lasts for over a day. I just charge for 10 minutes in a day and even if I play battery draining games, the battery lasts for over 24 hrs. Android 11 is also awesome. Getting used to the new features. No lag till now. Frame rate is also high. Everything is smooth.Just one thing that I wish it had was a headphone/earphone jack and a earphone packaged into the box. I don't know if Oneplus will (in future) add back the headphone jack. But nowadays, all phone companies are removing it. So, not something related to just this company.

  The phone is my first Oneplus device and it has impressed me quite well. The display is beautiful and crisp. The phone feels sturdy and easy to hold after putting on the delivered plain case. Opening apps are a breeze and the UI is minimal with not much bloat. The pics are above average in daylight and good conditions. The monochrome mode is quite fun. But overall white balance is still a hit or miss. And the camera software smoothens out some features that make some pics a bit unnatural sometimes.The charging is very very fast. And the battery stays for a whole day under heavy use.No IP68 rating, no hand gestured photo taking capability like Samsung. But overall, for the price, a top value pick and this is from a Samsung fanboy.

The phone comes with back cover and screen guard. The oxygen OS is very light skin on stock android. It doesn't come with hd wallpapers. The facelock is super fast. The macro camera is great but over all camera does not compete with Samsung or pixel 5 and iPhone 11.

  It's an amazingly fast device which uses the ultra fast refreshing rate 120hz,I have switched from OnePlus 6T to 8T and quality and experience improvement can be judged very easily. The touch response time is very fast, and at outdoor condition you will face no issues as its having brightness of 1100nits, The speakers are also very loud and clear and the haptic feedback is also very good, like while you're gaming you can feel every vibrations pretty well and battery life in general is solid and it's also have warp charge 65 technology so no issue with battery life and last but not least the cameras also having decent performance but it can further more improved by software updates specially in low light conditions. So just go for it.

  This phone definitely a flagship and beast in performance that's for sure . Performance is top notch no complaints at all. Battery life is ok but could hve been better as it's having 4500 mah, but on the other hand 65 watss charger steals everything thing and am happy they charge insanely fast.Camera <U+0001F4F8> : both cameras are good captures excellent pics.How can I forget the speakers , too loud and awesome display. In a nutshell.. close ur eyes and go for it.One plus good job <U+0001F44D>

  To be honest OnePlus 8T is a awesome mobile with latest Oxygen OS based on Android 11 Operating system. However, couple of cons which i have noticed is; 1) Battery: Need to charge twice a day- all credit to Warp Charge 65 power adapter which is really a boon while you need to charge twice a day.2) I am not sure if anyone has noticed, Mobile Bank applications like Canara bank and Yono (SBI) applications won't open. (Checked with other OnePlus 8T mate and same is the case)3) Camera is other drawback which i hardly use, so people who are not camera freak can ignore.Apart from the above everything is super cool, people can go for it & stay relaxed on the latest updates until next 5 years with 5G mobile.Thanks to Amazon for in time delivery.

  Review after 24 hrsPro -Best phone.Runs anything you give too smooooothly. Tried COD , Asphalt 9. <U+0001F525>Oxygen OS 11 and whole interface is easy and fast.Best display with Amoled & 120Hz refresh rate while surfing or gaming. No display issue as observed on 8 & 8 Pro.Good battery backup,could last one day for moderate usage.Charging speed 0-100 in 39-45mins.Aquamarine green do looks more amazing in actual. Phone looks good & premium.Cons -One star less for Camera quality. For this price we expect a better camera.IP rating and Wireless charging was too expected at this price range.Noticed a little bit heat at start while loading all apps and setting. But later no heat was observed while using, gaming or charging.Don't think much just buy it if you have it in your mind.Hope it was helpful.Thanks for listening.

  Pros:- 120Hz Supersmooth display- Flat display is a welcoming change- Lunar Silver looks very elegant and professional- Performance is very great- Camera is good- Battery charging speed is insaneCons:- Purplish tinting when set on minimum brightness only appears while scrolling- Camera could be better they are using same old sensors which they have used on past generation of one plus devices- 10X zoom is bad. Seems like oil painting at that range- Phone gets hot while charging usually.- Battery backup could be better but charging speed compensate for that

  Meets all expectations! Nothing to complaint about it rather than I will say expandable storage..but still 256gb storage is more than enough.Performance is smooth without any lag or hiccups. Snapdragon 865 is a true multitasker. RAM management is excellent!120hz gives you the feeling as if you are gliding through the screen. Never faced any overheating even while charging with that amazing 65W charger.Camera was not my priority but still it is more than capable of day to day usage. Works satisfactorily in low light as well. Would have been better if IMX686 sensor was provided as main sensor.Haptics and sound quality is amazing!Overall I am satisfied with OP..My first OP device and I am enjoying the experience!

  Been using for a couple of days now. I upgraded from a redmi note 5 pro. I see night and day and in performance of the 2 phones.The camera , in the few pictures I took looked really good. The display is an absolute beast. It just looks gorgeous. The 120Hz just makes it even better. Battery seems decent till now. I feel it is absolutely worth my money.

  This is my first one plus device and I was quite skeptical about downgrading from a QHD+ display (LG V30+) to a Full HD+ display just for the performance but the performance is mind-blowing. Everything is just fluid. 120hz refresh rate is clearly felt when you switch between 60hz and 120hz. The dual speaker setup is fantastic, it has little bassy elements that make listening experience great. Camera still needs improvements and wish a s/w update fixes the issues. The warp charge 65 is great too. Took 20 mins to reach 90% from 25%.Snapdragon 865 under the hood is definitely fast enough to run anything you throw at it coupled with 12 gigs of memory. Overall it's a worthy purchase for the price you pay.

  1) Got this device delivered yesterday and it started heating up during the setup stage only. I ignored it for a while. After charging, thought of transferring my data from my old device to this and with just with just contacs, messages and approx 20 songs the device started heating up again.2) Next, having a warp charger doesn't make sense if the battery is drains at a pretty good speed.3) I have my Airtel sim in the 2nd slot but I cannot use 4g data in that and it is always on 2g network only, God knows why? And OnePlus is marking it as a 5G flagship.About to return the product.Really disappointed.

Most of the images from other cam is not natural it destroys the sharpness.All the plus gets destroyed just for the worse camera. Totally disappointed with the cam performance

  I would not review the specs and other details which are easily available in other reviews, would just like to share my experience.This is a flagship phone! Truly premium and rich. For someone who requires a great processor and a great camera, this serves the purpose. I am an amateur photographer and I was very happy with the reproduction of natural scene by sensors like these! The ultrafast charge and a battery that stays more than a day with mid heavy usage, is the need of the hour. I can manage my tasks at office and home with still more juice left. Gamers, with a refresh rate like 120Hz, I need not say more. To summarise, go ahead if you have the budget and the need. Definitely a great product!

  The OnePlus 8T is a worthy upgrade over its predecessor from six months ago with a better display, faster charging and a new design. While it does add an extra camera to the mix, photography is once again the weakest point of an otherwise great phone.Display: 6.55-inch AMOLED, 120HzDimensions: 160.7mm x 74.1mm x 8.4mmWeight: 186 gramsProcessor: Snapdragon 865 with 5GRAM: 8GB/12GB LPDDR4XStorage: 128 GB/256 GB UFS 3.1Camera: 48MP + 16MP + 5MP + 2MPFront camera: 16MPBattery: 4,500mAh (non-removable)Charging: 65W Warp Charge

  If you're looking for flagship level performance and dont want to spend 50k+ then this is the phone for you if u got 43-46k(u may get for less after disc) also charging is very fast and battery lasts a day on normal usage.Flat display is preferred by many although the curved one looks better but flat will last you better so do consider that .. curved displays are expensive to repair as well compared to the flats.Only setback is the camera which is great too but not the best in this segment but anyway there's no phone in this range which will give u evrything best.. hence u should consider that if u just want the cam, I prefer performance and features so i chose it

I have start torch only one LED was working so I have filed replacement for the same, then I got the advice and clearification form my friend who is techy guy and expert in smartphone. That LED which is placed on top is flicker senser not LED. So I have cancelled the return and finally kept the phone with me....It was very good support from Amazon as well.Thank You and Finally One Plus 8T is Ossam...Recommended to buy without hesitation..

Seems to be storage or software issue.3) Battery gets drain very fast even though with normal uses. Yesterday I hardly able to get backup of 10 hrsBattery is the main concern to worry however I will be checking this for one more day and then decide to keep it or return

  Thank you Amazon for the fast delivery, got this beast the next day. This is my first Oneplus Phone. At first I was confused between MI10T pro and Oneplus 8T. Finally made up my mind and went for OP8T. It was one of the best choice ever made. 120Hz refresh rate, Amoled display with brightness of 1100 nits!! SD865 processor with 5g, quad cameras, 65W fast charging which charges 0-100 in approx 40-45 mins. Battery life is good. Doesnt heat much while normal usage or while charging. No lags at all. Super smooth touch.Cons:Average cameras: 48 mp for a flagship phone! Could have been better, but its good. I hope it'll improve after some software updates.

  Overall the phone is damn good, but I see some following issues in the phone like,1. IVR will not work all the time.2. Notifications are not syncing, though I read the message, still the notification will not clear.3. Sometimes if I click on the notification, it will not redirect to the app. I need to open it manually and clear the notification manually again.4. Keypad will jam quite often while switching from text to emoji and vice versa.I would request OnePlus team to focus on these bugs and fix it ASAP.

  I was using samsung before buying this phone. But when I heard the price, it felt like its offering flagship features for midrange value, so I bought it. Have to say this that its hardware and processor is best in class, but when it comes to UI it fails miserably. The features, ease of use and customisations that One UI provides are just on next level and can't be compared with the low level and totally buggy Oxygen OS. Its almost same like stock android with slight changes which are taken from One UI. Don't buy this if your old phone is Samsung, its just downgrade.

  I ordered this product on Sat night and received it on Monday noon , being a first time One-Plus user, I now get why people are crazy for this brand, the charging is super duper fast, 18 mins and you are half way through. 120Hz refresh rate is impressive but consumes a lot of power, hence I did switched it to 60Hz (Not bad at all). Camera quality is nice (I am not pro-camera person , so for me it did just the apt thing). Multi-tasking is peanut for this device, no issue with heating. Overall a super bundled package. Thank you Amazon & One-Plus :)

  It is a great phone with amazing performance. Battery life is good and charging is superfast. Display is also amazing with that 120Hz refersh rate. I did not see any display issue like black crush or any color tint. Camera is not that good though, that is the only weak link. Giving one star less only for poor camera.

  Highly recommended for people who want to have a superfast phone. It is best for gaming and has flat screen so u can easily get a compatible tempered glass and cases. Battery backup is good with 120hz turned on it gave me always around 6.5 hrs of screen on time can be even high if 60 hz is turned on. Full charge in 39 mins.

  The best daily driver you can get under 50K.Benefits over the competition:1.Fast Charging 65W (under 40mins 100percent)2. 120Hz refresh rate3.Great performance4. Close to stock Android feel.5. If bought with offers effective price is pretty good.Cons:1.Camera could have been better.2.Wireless Charging missing (if you care about this).3. No curved screen (depends on personal preference).

  Very good features. This is my first one plus device. OP 8T comes with an os11 which have very decent features like AOD. I used it for from past 7 days no lag at all.Pros:1. SD 865 processor it's very fast.Perfomance wise it's very good.2. 120hz display is very smooth3. Quick charge with in 40 minutes it's charge fully.Cons:Need to improve camera quality. I think that in coming updates one plus definitely give a update on this

  Firstly compared to 7t its not at all an upgrade.Camera is average, sensors given are given in 15-20k phones.battery compared to other phones not up to the mark as given..4500mah.Brightness issues it takes time to react while you increase or decrease brightness..It also gets a bit heated...<U+0001F631>. yes heat..not at all expected from one plus..During charge it gets heated while charging, while data tranafer, wifi amd hotspot users will surely experience heating issue..Not at all advisable to buy in 43k..

  I'm writing this review after I used it for 3 days. Phone performance is awesome. Super Fast. I haven't find any issues. It just took 34 minutes to charge from 15% to 100%. Camera, display, call clarity everything is good. May get bothered when you're playing some music with full volume bcoz you will get little vibration/disturbance from phn bcoz of high volume. Android 11 UI is fantastic, very easy to navigate to other apps r options & also some new features in Android 11. Overall, it's worth the money.

  After using a week . Either Use or standby battery will drains fast . Performance good, it's compact and weight is well balanced . Camera is good not excellent.It's not a premium phone .looks they released to cover 40k segement and compromised.Few reviews says colour issue over screen and heating issues. I don't have any. Probably they recieved faulty . As there is sale ,there will huge number sale happened . In them there is few people would have recieved faulty and reviewed here .

  You cannot go wrong with this buy. True flagship. If you are upgrading from existing one plus model you will not notice the difference as OS is the same, but as use the phone you experience the superiority of your device: higher refresh rate, really quick charging, speed ,premium looks and so many other features that amplify the happiness of buying a one plus product.

  Absolutely worth the price. Very light in weight with a flat screen and a perfect grip. Ulta smooth scrolling and amazing camera quality. The 48mp camera gives really crisp and clear images. Video quality is also excellent and meets all expectations. The best part of the device is the warp charge 65. Less than 40mins the device is fully charged. What more specifications can one demand from a phone? Already in love with the product. #neversettle #oneplus8t <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+0001F4AF>

  Awesome phone. Pros everyone are aware of. I will talk about the Cons.1. Phone heating up quite a lot. Almost every task you perform will heat up the phone.2. Camera is not up to that level. Went for OnePlus 8t instead of MI 10t for overall package but camera seems a big let down as compared to its competitor.Other than these 2 major Cons the phone is excellent in performance and call quality.Gaming in it is amazing and exciting.

  Given the price point and offers, the phone is a beast is the least, I could say.120 hz refresh, bigger battery, the overall UI experience, everything is good. Specially the box came with every small things that you may need to start the device.Just that the camera needs some upgrade.Photos added are simple with no HDR or edits.Got same day delivery in Hooghly, Kolkata..<U+0001F60D><U+0001F970>

   Up to the standard set by one plus.This review is after 24h usage. Screen time of 4.5h and battery is 50% now. Good battery life. Device got a little heated during the setup, but fine later on. Outstanding display and sound quality! Feels slightly heavier, continuous one hand use causes some pain.Have added the unboxing video of oneplus 8T.

  This is my third oneplus device preferred this over oneplus 8 becos of flat screen and 65w charging.Even though the form factor is big the phone seems to be well balanced in weight.As usual camera in day light is good but when there is no light you can find grains when zoomed in.Final vedict: overall a good phone in this prize range which has no unwanted ad pop-ups.

  Had ben using 5T for 3 years and then upgraded to this. 65W charging and 120Hz refresh rate are the only proper upgrades that I'm very happy about. The camera is good but not great. Battery gives me about 4.5 - 5 hours of screen time and should easily last for a day. Yet another smooth device from OnePlus that's as fast as it gets. It's time OnePlus adds water resistance.

Only 1 thing which I faced as a issue , when playing pubg or other high graphics game , after 20 min , u will feel heating issues .

  For review and working of the phone, please go to Youtube, you will get much better reviews of the product. I upgraded from Samsung to Oneplus and every penny is worth. If you are a Oneplus 8 user, no need to upgrade but if not and you are looking for a flagship with a 50K budget then you must go for this phone without giving a second thought. Though I did my own research, you can also decide after viewing unboxing and reviews on Youtube. :-)

  Not happy with the way they are handling  replacement of 8t. My one plus 8t was delivered on October 18.My camera was not working, so I complained for replacement on the same day of delivery. The technician came on October 21 (after three days of delivery) and lodged for replacement.Now they are giving me replacement by November 1. This is not done as new phone is arrived within two days of order while replacement takes 10days. Poor service indeed.

  Very poor battery back up, my earlier one plus 6 and 7 devices were lasts for whole day and night, I usually charge my phone in the morning, but this device in full charge with moderate use lasts only for 12 hours, I have charged the phone and it confirms now that it takes more than one hour to charge the device from 6% to 100%, screen quality and sound quality is average, it is highly by overpriced.

  After an uasage of a day, i am writing my first impression:1. Battery draining off as fast as it is getting charged. I had to charge 3 times in a single day..2. Front Camera quality is very poor. No AI or beauty mode is seen, which is the most common feature nowadays.Over all disappointed with ONEPLUS 8T. Not served the purpose for which it was intended to.Will try for a replacement and again review the same..

  First and most important is its battery and the charging speed. It takes 40 min to charge full. Secondly I love Lunur silver colour coz it's very decent and looks premium in hand. I'm not a camera person but still it takes high quality photos and for normal usage, it's more than the expectations. It's my first OnePlus mobile shifted from Samsung and it tooks me to next level in mobile experience.  Must buy product if you considering more than 40k mobile.

  The display of the 8T is really good with the 120hz refresh rate. The phone heats up quite frequently. The camera performance is very mediocre. It can be hardly considered to belong in the cost segment it's priced at. The photographs are excessively smoothened out and lacks detail. The saturation and colour is also compromised. This is a big letdown. The macro and the super macro modes are also pretty bad. The cellular network range is not good too.

  A smooth phone as expected from OP with good battery back up and fast charging (though it has reached 58% for me instead of 60% in 15 min, it hardly matters). OS11 is also fast and easy with good camera output. A good phone at this price point.

  Up to the mark product.  Camera is awesome. Charging  is getting  done in less than 30 minutes. Batry backup is good.  The price worth product.The only drawbavk with the item that you will not get headset.  So if you have Bluetooth headset then there is not a problem.  For avoiding  charging  of Bluetooth  headset frequenty I have bought Type c to 3.5 mm  audio  jack from amazon only.Awesome  product and I am enjoying  it alot :)

  Smartphone battery is good, but it's charging speed make it awesome. Processor, ram, storage, os are best. For gaming it's the best option. But the only area where it gets very little behind is camera, only a little improvement is needed, you are giving 48mp, while others are giving 64, 108 etc, but the real problem  atleast make your 48 mp better with software improvements. It started showing disturbance at full 48 mp zoom.

  Battery is draining like a 2-3 years old phone. Battery backup is very poor and battery is lasting only for 6-7 hours even for the moderate usage. Expected more from 4500mah battery, but it's totally disappointment. My old oneplus 3t mobile battery will last more than this brand new onleplus 8t. Playing high-end games will drain the battery from 100 to 0 in 3-4 hours.OnePlus team please do the needful..!!!!!!!

  Overall A Nice Phone except one thing which can bother to selfie lovers is that the front camera being placed at the top left corner of the phone which makes taking selfies difficult as a person has to adjust the position for a straight selfie.Otherwise obviously One Plus Phones never diappoint users while considering other factors.Just In case the selfie camera doesnt bother you then go for it for sure.

  Amazing product from OnePlus. The image quality is amazing and the phone gets charged in less than half an hour. Even with high usage throughout the day,the battery lasts for an entire day. I was confused whether I should go for a OnePlus phone or an iPhone but after using this for around 3 days now, I can say that it is worth it.

Regarding Camera you may be disappoint, but may be in future with software updates it can be solved.Overall good performance, but while playing high graphic game with UltraHD settings might feel resolution getting distorted sometime, maybe it could be due to network issue.

  very good phone. Lunar grey colour looks good. Iam getting really good screen on time and warp charge 65 is daamn fast... phone has a good weighted feeling... although I felt the shipping was kinda slow but it was packaged properly. No screen issues. No heating issues after playing COD after an hour.

  I got it on the 18. Of Oct and using it for the past 2 days . The battery is great, SF charging and the diapaly resolution is great. But the only prob is its having some issues with Google drive backing up my what's app. Can any body tell wat the prob is. I hv also tried rebooting the device and reinstalled the what's a couple of times.

  Looks good. Battery drainage is there. But as os11 just arrived we have to wait to get stabilised. Yes 60hz makes it more longer than 120hz. They could he have given 90hz option which is absent. Touch, sound, feel, videos, gaming all looks perfect as expected.Water proof or water resistance could have been given. We should be careful with Mike and speaker as they are not water resistance.

  Yes phone is fast, 120hz - good, display - superb, battery- ok full day goes, now camera give output like u brought 10k phone...Compared it with few samsung cameras of lower range..Expected at least if spend 41k then camera should have descent images.Better to go for this one if ur not gamer, else Nord is good if u want oxygen os, else go for samsung any mid range or A Series.

  This phone is awsome!!!! Battery life is very good while using whole day... it's remain 20% end of the day if not charge while using. It's 100% value of money because you'll get all the features, software and perfomance in this cost by other phones. The best part of this phone is processer and refresh rate. It's also working smooth on 60hz. So this phone is warmth.<U+0001F44D><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+263A><U+FE0F>

  Don't buy this... It is not worth. This quality is same as a Oppo mobile because Oppo Mobiles India is manufacturing this product. Camera and picture quality is not good. OnePlus has made a fool out of people. This phone is not that great as that of other OnePlus phones. 7 series was better than this. From the first day double tap(quick gestures) for screen lock is not working.

  Bought 12 GB and 256 GB variant. Phone is monstrous and blazing fast. But, let down by camera. By the way attached images are taken by samsung Galaxy S8 which is 3.5 years old and still captures much better images than this device. Don't go for this device if you like clicking pictures a lot.

The great Indian festive sale is amazing for giving me such an amazing discount on latest device with their super fast and safe delivery. I give 10/10 to both Amazon and one plus.

  Bought last week but frequent call disconnections with 9 out of 10 calls getting disconnecting while on calls. This is causing embarrassment while on conference calls at work. Also doesn't allow to make outgoing calls randomly and has to be restarted.  Need to go for replacement with another model if issues persists with next 3 to 4 days.

   Hi,I have received a defective product. The phone gets switched off automatically after every 5-10 minutes. Battery gets completely drained within 3-4 hours without any use.

  The phone runs smooth with Android 11 update. The charging is way too fast. Camera quality is decent and selfie camera also delivers good results.With heavy usage, battery may drain out by late evening/night but hard to expect 24 hours lasting battery power. Overall, a great phone

  Please do NOT buy any OnePlus. They have inherent defect of calls not being displayed on screen and an OEM defect in camera focus.Also OnePlus is a Chinese company.I am now requesting for full refund as I am unable to see any incoming or outgoing call on the device. I can't even pick a call.

  Worst possible camera they could give in such a expensive phone. Look at the photos i have added, pictures are grainy and every pixel is about to explode. Also it requires to hold the camera for atleast 5 seconds after the shot to capture a stable image. 3 stars for fast charging and super fast processor. But camera is waste.

  I have been using OnePlus 6 and upgraded to 8T. It's super fast, camera z just fabulous and battery charges in light speed and lasts upto 14hr.Yes, it has some UI bugs but that will be resolved in patch updates.It's worth a single penny u will spend.

  Battery life of this phone is very good and can easily give you a days backup in full charge (Without gaming).The experience on Oxygen OS 11 is very smooth.The phones camera does a decent job but is not the best.However, to conclude the phone is value for money under the price range offered.

  
"

  I would say everything about the OnePlus 8t except the cameras are top quality. If you don't care about camera's much and performance and smoothness is your first priority then there isn't a better device then this in the Indian Market at this price.

  Awesome phone. Fast performance, fast charging. Battery sometimes drains quickly but charges full phone within 40-45 minutes.Best pair with OnePlus Bullets.Camera is also good.Overall, a great phone.

  In this price segment i think it is the best phone to consider,It handles all task smoothly,the phone feels buttery smooth,also the camera is very decent unless you are seeking to buy a phone with professional camera. I got screen on time of 6~7 hours easily.

  Good flagship phone. Charging to this phone is superb less than 35min takes to full from 10% battery. Allover it's specification is 80% good. Price is high compare to mi 10t. But 8t display and battery gives fight to mi10t.

  Amazing phone. Killer performance and display. Great battery life and super fast charging. Great in every aspect of a smartphone, but I still think that camera can be improved and one plus should have provided ip68 rating at this price point.

  Becareful, this is just marketed with warp 65 charging, 120 hz and rest isnt good. Poor display camera is bad. Quad cam setup is just a marketing jimmic. OnePlus 7t pro or 8 are still good phones when compared to display and in the same price range.

  I don't know if this is happening only with me, battery backup is so bad in OP 8T. Ive turned on power saving and without even touching the phone it drops 5% in an hour. I have to charge it 2 times in a day without heavy usage like gaming and all.
